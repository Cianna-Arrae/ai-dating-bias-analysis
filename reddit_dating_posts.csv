datingoverthirty,[UPDATE] He broke up with me on Monday,"[The original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/1jg9rzo/dating_with_marriage_in_mind_how_long_do_you_give/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

In my last post, I mentioned my (29F) boyfriend (35M) had started acting distant—right around the time his parents’ health issues worsened and he began prepping for a non-urgent surgery. He said his behavior was due to stress, and I chose to trust that and support him. Still, he stopped talking about introducing me to his family and just seemed emotionally off.

After another low-energy weekend, we had a call to discuss an upcoming trip he used to want me to join. Now he didn't. I asked how he felt about us, and he admitted he wasn’t sure. He said he’d been wondering whether he was just off due to stress or whether it was something deeper. He’d been questioning things but trying to pretend everything was fine. He also said part of him was unsure about being in a relationship at all, after over a decade of living alone.

He was kind and empathetic, said he didn’t want to throw away something so good or cut me off, but also felt it's unfair to me. So I told him we both have some thinking to do.

But just a few hours later, after talking to his therapist and mentor, he called and came over to end things. He returned my stuff and said he didn’t see a future with me anymore. He kept saying how “crazy” it felt not to feel a spark for someone he considers wonderful, that I’ve been supportive, kind, beautiful, hardworking, and fun, but he just no longer felt the connection he wanted long-term. 

He thanked me for having the emotional maturity to ask him where he stood, because it helped him get clarity. He was emotional about ending what he called his first serious and healthy relationship, and said he’s taking a break from dating for now.

This happened just a couple of days ago, so I’m still processing everything. We’re meeting again tonight to talk things through one more time. I have a lot of questions—but also feel completely at a loss for what to say.

This isn’t how either of us wanted things to end, but I still want to thank everyone who commented on my original post. Your insights truly helped me, and I’m really grateful for this community.",,101,57,2025-04-03 17:38:22

datingoverthirty,Would you consider this as dishonesty?,"I (36M) would say that I appreciate honesty and that I often don't trust people too quickly. I recently started seeing a woman (32) whom I find very attractive and whose personality and interests match mine. We have gone on one date, exchanged texts, and spoken on the phone. What I discovered was:

 

1. When I inquired about her work. She mentioned that she works for a food company in an administrative role. She said that she serves as a coordinator between staff members and other departments when I pressed her to be more specific. Upon returning home, I looked her up on LinkedIn and discovered that she works as a front desk receptionist. I reminded her of it, and she explained that she wrote it this way since her firm doesn’t have an actual job title that fits what she actually does (despite the fact that the job description she wrote on LinkedIn fits front desk receptionist, not an administrator as she had previously stated).

 

2. Her speech is always very soft and calm with me. Even yet, there were two instances in which I heard her natural voice: the first time we were together on a date, and the time we were on the phone and someone asked her a question, she answered in a different voice before switching back to the quiet tone to proceed with our conversation. I felt that something odd was going on here because of this.

 

So, do you think I am overthinking these small details?",,0,34,2025-04-03 12:37:20

datingoverthirty,Guy who is unwilling to be intimate early on in a relationship,"This is me. I’m turning 30 soon, and consider myself unwilling to be intimate early on in any relationship. 

I’ve had two relationships in my life (and dates here and there in between). Even though I’ll soon be in my thirties, I’ve only been intimate with two people (total). Of course, I’m willing to go on dates to get to know someone better and see if there’s any connection, but I draw the line at sex and intimacy. That’s something I reserve for people who I’m serious about. I don’t think anybody needs to wait until marriage, but for me, it has to be at least two months (or so) of knowing someone to want to be intimate. That’s at least 7 dates or so, and by that time I would at least have a good idea of where the relationship is going. 

I feel like my thought process is controversial, because every time I talk about this, people seem to think that I’m wrong to feel this way. But from my perspective, this is how I know if a relationship has what it takes to last (or if we don’t share the same values).

I’m not particularly religious or anything, but I just don’t feel comfortable being intimate with anyone I don’t really know. Sex is not just an activity to me. If I’m with someone who wants to initiate a sexual relationship early on, I conclude that they’re not the right fit for me (since I assume that they have no problem going on apps and hooking up or having casual encounters). That doesn’t represent me, and I’d be a hypocrite otherwise. 

I think it’s important to note that I don’t go into any relationship expecting to date someone who is a virgin. I myself am not. However, I don’t have any interest in dating someone who (at the bare minimum) doesn’t make an effort to get to know me properly. There’s just no chance that I’ll ever be able to relate to anyone who is more casual about how they approach a relationship. People will call you all sorts of names on the internet for expressing this opinion, but why shouldn’t I have it? I’ve held myself to this standard. 

My friends say that I’m going to end up alone, because “everybody who is dating is having sex right away.” Good for them, but frankly, I’d probably prefer to be alone if someone (at the very least) cannot respect my values. I feel like I have a lot to offer, and I don’t feel obligated whatsoever to date someone just to avoid being alone. I went on a date with someone a few years ago who got angry after I told her that I’m not interested in sleeping with her until I get to know her properly. I think she had never been told “no” before. 

I would like to know if I am alone in this, or if other people feel the same way. My friends have tried to get me to change and be open to casual relationships (or at least dating people who have done that stuff before). But im going to stay true to myself. I would never feel comfortable. 

TLDR: I’m turning 30 and am against casual relationships and don’t want to date someone who wants this kind of arrangement. Does that mean I don’t have a chance at finding the right person for me?

EDIT: I would like to point out that if I were a female writing this, I feel like the responses I receive would be vastly different. ",,135,443,2025-03-31 18:10:09
datingoverthirty,Reject in person or over text?,"I [32M] have a second date today with a woman [28F] and she asked me a good question about kids (specifically, would I freeze my sperm before getting a vasectomy) that I’ve had a chance to think about since then (it’s been a week and some change). It didn’t make me doubt my decision to not have them but it did make me think about how I have changed as a person throughout my life, and what value this would add for me.

That being said, I’m standing firm on not wanting kids, so I don’t see a reason to have that freezing done. As a result, I do not want to pursue things further with her, as she is working towards being at a point where she can have kids (mentally, financially, etc.) even though she doesn’t want them now, and I don’t want them at all.

I planned on just letting her know at the end of the date that while I have enjoyed getting to know and date her, I ultimately want someone who is on the exact same page with regards to not wanting kids and that I wish her the absolute best. Which brings me back to the original question of rejecting in person or text.

I like the idea of doing this in person to clarify that this is a lifestyle incompatibility rather than me not actually liking her or wanting to get to know her better. I’ve also been broken up with via text (and have also gotten the “we’re not compatible” text literally a day after getting a woman’s number lol) so I prefer not to pass that hurt on via text.

ETA: Probably should have said over phone instead of text, as I’m also perfectly fine with calling to do it.

ETA2: I ended it over a phone call. I thanked her for her time and I told her that I would prefer to end things here given that I want to be more intentional about dating someone who doesn’t want kids. She said good luck with my search as well. I think my anxiety was starting to boil over the longer I prolonged it, so I just did it over a call. I gotta embrace the “fail fast” mentality more with respect to dating. Thanks everyone!",,193,116,2025-03-31 13:33:44
datingoverthirty,What does our future hold?,"I (35M) have been dating my partner (40F) for a little less than a year now. Very much in love, can't stand being away from her for long. Usually we get along wonderfully, with a few arguments here and there. Normal stuff, usually centers on some behavior of mine that upsets her, feels like we've recently graduated out of honeymoon phase into real partners

We're starting to think about a future together. I recently bought a house and plan for her to move in with me there in a few months. She wanted me to move in with her in her condo but I didn't feel ready, don't like spending time there, and felt a little early for taking that step. When it comes to the future, we've talked about wanting kids, but her age is somewhat of an issue. I am not 100% I want kids, due to some genetic factors I'd rather not pass down. She does, badly, and believes she still can, but we're at least a year away from trying. EDIT: I have talked with her about this multiple times, she knows where I am with it.

Increasingly, I've been wondering if she's really the one. She and I have some differences of opinion when it comes to ambition, drive, priorities that have been surfacing more recently. Part of me wonders whether we're right for each other long term, and it feels like we're getting toward an inflection point. I'm so in love with her, just want to be with her over everything else, but also worry that I'm somehow making a mistake. I have a past history of sabotaging relationships, and worry I might be doing that.

What are your thoughts? How can I know she's the one forever? How can I know I'm not just sabotaging things?

EDIT: fwiw I love her and want to be with her, can see us getting married and having a family. Been regretting the house purchase. She insists it’s ok and is excited about the house but I can’t help but feel I’ve made the wrong decision for us and our future",,43,86,2025-03-31 20:46:40
datingoverthirty,How long before sleeping with a guy?,"I (31F) just got back into the dating scene after a year. I am a romantic and I am looking for a serious boyfriend that could lead to marriage and I have a high sex drive. The problem is I don’t know how long to wait before having sex with a guy. I obviously don’t want to sleep with everyone I meet. I most importantly don’t want to be considered “easy” if I am willing to do it too soon. It’s just so happened many times in the past that I get pushed off into the casual bucket, then it wigs me out and I end up deleting the apps for a few months. But physically intimacy is very important to me too. Ofcourse I do realize that nothing guarantees permanence but I would like to attract guys that are also looking for that from me. 
So now… how long do I wait?

datingoverthirty,How to deal with disappointment after a great second date? This is silly?,"My original post yesterday that everyone gave great advice on: https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/1jlx5ch/comment/mken6v2/?context=3. Thank you all.

Went on a second date last night. Three hours later shut the bar down, he kissed me in the parking lot (I kind of get vibes we're both equally bad at dating), the kiss was great, he got my phone number, kissed me again at my car, texted me when I got home, and we've been texting today. I am a HORRIBLE texter (exception: I send my best friend voice memos all day and vice a versa), so I can already feel myself being like ""shit, what do i say?"" but we've exchanged a few over the course of the day. I left for a weekend trip with friends, he's working out of town for a week (common for his field without giving further info). No plans set up for a third date. But I've been saying to myself all day, ""this felt really good, trust the process"".

Just now, I decided to look at the facebook ""Are we dating the same guy?"" group for my area...There's someone asking for any tea on him, with a screenshot of his profile, 23 hours ago. Fortunately, there was no tea (which doesn't surprise me). But it just gave me this sinking feeling. I assume women don't post in there unless the date is imminent, or they've been on a couple dates with the man. I realize this is so silly and stupid, of course everyone on the apps is matching with other people. But it just feels extra gross. As luck would have it, this is the first guy 

How do I compartmentalize this to manage my expectations, and not shut myself down and be like ""meh, forget this guy"", when I know this is common?",,68,71,2025-03-29 21:00:26
datingoverthirty,Determining the Relationship timing,"Hey DOT! 

I’ve (37F) been dating an incredible man (33M) for a few months. We met at a work event in November but didn’t go on our first date until basically January. Then I left for over a month. Now we’re back in our city and properly seeing each other for the past month (so timeline of how long we’ve been dating can feel murky). 

He’s incredible. We both admit to feeling safe with each other and so comfortable. There have been intense feelings of love, you know the looks the inseparability while together etc. 

Given that we met in person and not in a dating context we didn’t have a chance to dig Dee into what the other is looking for. It went from
Acquaintances to dating quickly. I’m normally someone who checks for relationship capability with what I’m looking for (relationship/marriage) early on. 

He’s going on vacation for a few weeks. Things with him have been so natural, no dating anxiety, just easy. I figured I would wait until he returns from his trip (2-3 weeks) before determining the relationship. 1) I feel like vacations are a natural point where feelings can drop 2) We’re really still getting to know one another and it feels nice and so natural. I feel secure in what we have now and that the convo will be positive. But I’d like to enjoy our time for the next two weeks so that we can really have a strong assessment before taking it to the next level, with as little unnatural pressure as possible 

My question for you all, does it make sense to have this convo before or after vacation? Ty!!",,29,43,2025-03-29 14:47:30

datingoverthirty,What are common second date expectations?,"33F. Came out of a 1.5 year relationship recently (nothing traumatic--we'd been done for awhile and just grown apart), and installed dating apps last week. I was never great at these to begin with, but I'm worse than ever.

Matched with a guy (31M) on Tuesday and met up that evening for a boozy milkshake. I had to leave after 50 minutes bc I had dog training class. He didn't ask much about me during the meet up, we mostly talked about him. Not in a conceited way, we didn't have much time. He hugged me when we left. He made no effort to get my phone number, but did message me on the app later about something and i joked he owed me a beer, and he asked what a good night to do that was. We have settled on tonight. He has picked a place, but not planned a time.

I'm realizing I have no memory of what standard expectations are for a second date. Do people typically kiss at the end of a second date? **MEN--If you don't kiss on a second date, do you assume she's not interested?** What about value type questions--I'm 33 and what I loathe about dating is the lost time, so I want to ask value questions--Ie, where do you see yourself long term, kids, views of marriage and partnership, etc. I don't force them, but I personally feel they should be brought up fairly early on. However, I was told by my (now) ex that I quote ""would be a great corporate attorney bc our first date was like a deposition"". That stung, and it makes me paranoid maybe people aren't suppose to ask screening questions early on?

Anyways. **What are the typical social and physical expectations and topics of a second-ish date?**

BONUS QUESTION: I currently have ***three*** dogs. Two are permanent. **When do I bring that up in dating?** My ex hated them (never openly said it, but there were subtle signs, and when we were breaking up, he outright said he saw them as ""my excessive responsibilities"" and didn't want to help me with them even though he's known the young dogs since they were puppies), so it's made me really paranoid that in dating, men will see me as ""that crazy dog lady who has three dogs and raises chickens on some land"" and not a potential dating partner. A lot of men put that they love dogs in their dating profiles, but I think most assume women have like a doodle that goes out for pup cups and brunch patios. I have malinois, I invest a substantial amount of time into training. The dogs are a really important piece of my life.",,78,100,2025-03-28 15:03:15

datingoverthirty,Making a significant other feel at home,"Edit: wow! Thank you for the super positive responses! To get the super main takeaway responded to: after this post, I asked him what would make him more comfortable here, and he said that I make him comfy. I told him the small things I’ve done today (bathroom and drawer space, fave snacks and drinks, etc), and he was so super thankful. It sounds like I’m on the right track, and I’m so super grateful for every single response. This group is seriously is so supportive and I’m thankful for you all.

Hello! Happy Spring! 😁 My (37F) boyfriend (39m) and I have been together for 6 months and he stays over regularly (1-2 nights/week). Over the weekend he brought over a toothbrush to keep here and has been bringing his “next day” stuff so we can spend the next day together.

What are some of the best ways to embrace that and make him feel more at home without making it feel like I want him to move in? (he knows I don’t want to live together unless we are engaged… he was until a couple of years ago in a very long term relationship without marriage or engagement, and I was married for a long time).  Edit: this boundary isn’t in place to force anything… I don’t need to beg a man to ask my hand in marriage.

datingoverthirty,Can anyone shed some light on what it’s like dating a woman who is in law enforcement?,"I’ve (36 M) been seeing this woman (32) for 5 months now. Things have been going well I must say. We have great communication. We spent nights at each others places and it is truly a stark contrast to what I’ve experienced in the past, meaning it is not toxic. It feels peaceful and really smooth. But a part of me is telling me it’s too good to be true. 

While things have been great, I can’t help but feel uneasy at times. This mainly revolves around her line of work and her secrecy with her phone. She gets a lot of messages. Some from her girlfriends, which she lets me in on. And then others within people in her department. She has to constantly be plugged in because of her job. However, she has shared that her boss, who happens to be her partner, sends her memes and the convos seem to blur the lines of professionalism. They are very chummy. But I wonder if a line has ever been crossed between them two. She has said that law enforcement is a different industry and that partners need to have each others backs, so I guess that’s why their friendlier than normal? But from stories she has shared about her work, people in her department go to her to ask her what is up regarding her boss, as if she’s his work wife.

I like this girl, but the phone secrecy and the relationship dynamic with her boss is something concerning. Can anyone shed light on what their experience was like? Or am I a fool look to sabotage something good. Thanks everyone ✌🏽 ",,35,93,2025-03-24 15:52:08

datingoverthirty,I hooked up with a scientist visiting my work and he unfollowed me after he flew back home. No explanation. Concerned about my job. Should I ask him?,"The company I (female 35) work for flew in a scientist (male 42) from Italy for a 2 week project. We started flirting and had sex a couple of times. I knew it wasn’t serious since he was only here for 2 weeks.

He flew back home a couple of days ago, and I just noticed he unfollowed me on Instagram (but didn’t remove me as a follower), no explanation. He didn’t unfollow any of my other coworkers, although they are all males. 

I wasn’t expecting that from him. Was I gross? Did I smell? I’ve never had complaints, but what else would make someone go cold like that?

***QUESTION***

I’m now worried about my job. If he disliked me enough to unfollow, could he have said something to my coworker that might jeopardize my job?

Would it be weird to message him and ask what happened, or if my coworker knows? If it wasn’t for my job, I would just let it go. 

What should I do?

I feel like I made a huge mistake. Feeling ashamed and embarrassed as I type this. :(

datingoverthirty,He’s fantastic but…,"I’ve (38 f)been seeing a guy (36m) I met on Hinge since Dec. We only talked through the app for about a month, and have been seeing each other in person for about 2 months, meeting up about 1-2x/wk. We’re on the same page about all the big things, we have a similar sense of humor, some common interests, and work similar hours so our schedules mesh well. 

And he’s SO sweet!! We hadn’t been dating long when Valentine’s Day rolled around so I was cool not observing it but he remembered me mentioning I love to journal so he bought me a really beautiful new journal and a single white rose when we were out to dinner the night after “just because he wanted to celebrate how happy he was to have met me.” And we’ve had a lot of great conversations about politics and how much of a feminist I am and he totally supports all of it. So that’s what I’m working with - he’s thoughtful, sweet, remembers things I say, and he makes me laugh a lot. In general I really enjoy spending time with him.

BUT…there are some things giving me pause and I am curious if people find these dealbreakers or if I should wait and see what develops. 

1. He let me know he’s only had 3 relationships ever, the longest was a year. (He’s 36)

2. He’s pretty infatuated with me and all he wants to do now is make out (like I just want to watch a full movie without him saying “can we just kiss for 5 minutes?” that’s never just 5 min), and the entire time he whispers weird dirty talk in my ear about what he wants to do to me but…

3. When things progress to the bedroom he can’t usually get it up, especially when there’s a condom involved. (And I will absolutely always use one) 

4. He has admitted he’s been single for so long that he probably masturbates and watches too much porn, which is evident from some of the things he’s said he wants to do in the bedroom. I don’t know if that’s a real thing or something guys just say?
(Some of the stuff he’s into is very at odds with my feminist ideals, to say it lightly. Although all that seems to stay very firmly to the bedroom if that makes sense)

5. Maybe this one is petty but he’s a grown ass man who only has 2 bath towels. And both were dirty the one night I slept over. Which he knew ahead of time I was staying. (And no paper towels or napkins, he brought toilet paper out use at dinner one night when he cooked) 

All other things are fantastic…would you try to work through these things - how?? Or would you walk away before it gets any deeper? ",,138,334,2025-03-22 17:55:12

datingoverthirty,Am I going too out of my way and instead should wait for him to make a first move?,"I (F33) am newly back on the dating scene and was never great at it to begin with. I matched with (M35) earlier this week on bumble. We had a brief app conversation, and he wanted my number. We started texting, and have had both some really good banter, and we've also touched on some more important deeper topics too and it seems like we align well.

He's asked twice for my availability for nights and wants to take me to dinner. I feel like that's a tad intense for a first app meetup, but whatever. He has not scheduled anything however. He's also worked the last 4 nights (he works nights right now --not sure how he plans to take me to dinner, while he's been doing night shift).

He also sent me a snapchat request the Thursday, and has been sending me the occasional work selfie through there, we chat through there too. The text seems to have dropped off somewhat.

I have an extra ticket to a minor league hockey game tonight. I don't have anyone to go with, so I'm just going to go alone anyways--Should I offer it to him? Or does that just make me look easy/helps him put in even less effort? i'm really bad at dating and always end up being the one who plans fun ideas, but he also seems like a cool guy and i would like to meet him before I write this off.",,0,47,2025-03-22 19:06:28
datingoverthirty,"Dating with marriage in mind, how long do you give it before deciding it's not going anywhere?","I (29F) met my boyfriend (35M) five months ago, and we’ve been officially dating for 3.5. It started off really great—he’s thoughtful, kind, has a great sense of humor, and we have amazing chemistry. We also have similar values and life goals, and this has been the healthiest relationship I’ve had so far, which made me really excited… at least in the first 2–3 months.

Lately, though, I feel like the energy has shifted. He used to talk about how I’d meet his parents one day, but that just hasn’t come up for a while. We had a conversation about love around the 2.5-month mark. In past relationships, I’ve never had a problem saying it and hearing it back about a month in. But he said he needs more time and wants to take it slow—he wants to be sure it's real, authentic love. I respected that, but it left me wondering.

On the other hand, we’ve both been going through a lot. His parents recently had major health issues. I’ve been overwhelmed with work and sleep-deprived most days. He’s on a strict diet for medical reasons that requires home-cooked meals for months. Just this past weekend, he made a point to apologize for being distant, saying he was struggling with bad news about his parents’ health and that it wasn’t about me. And tonight, I had work late near his place and asked if I should stop by to say hi—he just said he was tired and heading to bed but would see me tomorrow.

So I can’t tell if this is just a rough patch, if the honeymoon phase is over, or if he’s pulling away.

I’ve been in two LTRs where my exes said they loved me but ultimately weren’t willing to commit—due to personal fears or family pressure. I promised myself I wouldn’t stay in a relationship if I knew it wasn’t going anywhere, even if no one was at fault. I know people take time to decide on long-term commitment, and life happens, and we’re all human… yada yada. But I don’t want to ignore early signs that this isn’t leading to marriage—because that’s what I ultimately want.

Most of his behaviors are totally understandable, especially given the external stress. But when I ask myself, *would I find this behavior acceptable in a man who’s becoming my husband one day?*… that’s when my doubts creep in. Like with meeting his parents—my engaged or married friends met their partners’ families *before* things were “serious-serious.” Yes, his parents are going through health stuff, and yes, bad timing—but still, what does it say about the chances he’s really my person?

So, if you’re dating with marriage in mind, when do you decide it’s time to cut your losses? How do you know when a relationship is just going through a rough patch versus when it’s already doomed?

**TL;DR:** Things started great, but my BF’s enthusiasm seems to have faded. Could be stress, could be doubts. When you’re looking for a life partner, how do you know when to wait things out vs. walk away?",,63,123,2025-03-21 05:37:53

datingoverthirty,Am I writing things off too early?,"I am hitting the big 40 this year. I do not want kids, lot of factors , never felt safe enough and fear of becoming a single parent. A traumatic labour at 16, growing up as a teenage mum being looked down on and losing that child when he was 7 due to brain injury and health issues coming with that. 
But I always just say ""kids are off the table"". 

I get a lot of younger men trying to chat me up, from like 27 to 35 or so. If they dont have a kid I just tell them straight away I am looking for something serious but because they have no kids and they say they want kids I just dont even get to know them as i see no point. I dont want to be a place holder until they meet someone to have a family with. 

There is this 27 year old guy now, been talking less than a week, he said he would only take someone serious if he sees them as the mother of their child. I told him this is it then because kids are not something I can give him. He still keeps persisting he still wants to get to know me bla bla bla.
Am I wrong for putting this no kids boundary out so early? But i do think it is something non compromisable and should be discussed early to avoid wasted time and hurt feelings. 
I do want something serious but maybe because I dont want kids I dont deserve it? Sometimes it feels like that. The men dnt take women serious unless their womb can grow a baby inside.

datingoverthirty,Wave of polygamous and open relationships,"Is it just me, or does it seem like there suddenly is this wave of open relationships coming in? I have met soo many people lately and have some friends who keep saying they are not in a relationship, even though they lived together for 2 years (I have 3 friends who all do this).. it's like everyone is so hyper scared of labels these days and feels trapped if you call your partner of several years for your girlfriend/boyfriend.. Of course, it doesn't matter to me what others do, but this does perplex me a bit..

I even once met a couple when going out where the guy was flirting hardcore with me, and he told me that they lived together but wasn't in a relationship and was free to do what they wanted.. but the girl kept dissappearing, and in the end, he found out that she was really hurt and he used an hour at the party to calm her down and reassure her.. 

But in general I often meet guys when going out that are all over me and interested in me that then later on in the end of the evening or the next day tell me that they have a girlfriend but wants to keep seeing me.. I get so exhausted by this.. I don't want to be part of anyone's relationship.. I don't want to be someones side piece and I hate that they only take themselves and their partners needs and wants into account but don't care about the feelings of the person they pull into this or ask if they even want to fool around with someone in a relationship.. I find it disrespectful and selfish that I don't get a say in this from the beginning..

Don't get me wrong.. I have absolutely no problem with open relationships, and people should do what they want as long as they keep me out of it 😅",,422,234,2025-03-17 14:05:21
datingoverthirty,Am I being toxic?,"I recently started dating a guy and it has been clear from the get go that he’s serious about getting to know me, which is great!

He’s saying and doing all the right things. He never late to dates. He’s considerate about how he engages with me. He does what he says he will do. He’s already asking about my birthday which is two months out.

The problem is….he’s not my type. And I don’t necessarily mean physically, I mean how I want to feel with a partner. I know I’m having a good time when me and a partner can’t stop laughing together. When we make little quips and riff. 

Me and this guy don’t do that. We don’t really laugh at all, but it’s still a nice time.

Is this a stupid/toxic reason to think that maybe this person isn’t right for me long term? 

It’s so rare to meet someone who engages respectful and honestly these days, so I don’t want to throw the baby out with the bath water here, but humor and levity are really important to me in a relationship. With this guy, it feels very grounded, solid, mature but also a little…repressed, if that makes sense. 

Any advice? 

Thanks,
(A *recovered* avoidant, thanks to ten years of therapy) ",,145,226,2025-03-17 13:49:32

datingoverthirty,Advice - after years of online dating I’m starting to be more interested in someone I’ve met from work,"As the title…. Spent years on and off doing online dating, when I meet someone or get sick of the apps, and on when I’m ready or it doesn’t work out with them.
Anyway, I’ve got a bit closer with someone I work with and I’d really like to keep getting to know them as more than a friend.
We’ve been for drinks a few times and there’s definitely chemistry, lingering eye contact and more arm touches etc than as just a friend.
My dilemma is how to kind of show I’m interested without being totally out there. One positive with online dating is that you date with intent (even if those intentions don’t line up with some people….) and know what you’re going for drinks for (eg knowing it’s a first date).
With a friend, it’s really hard because yes we meet up and have drinks, but I don’t know how they feel. I know the obvious answer would be to just tell them but I’m not there yet and don’t want to be hurt from rejection 

Sorry for the ramble! Any advice welcomed 


Edit to add: we don’t work together now as it was on a rotational job! But are in the same profession, don’t see each other at work as work in different places now ",,40,46,2025-03-15 23:21:22

datingoverthirty,Why no kids in profile pics?,"I’ve read many posts saying you should never ever show pictures of your kids, or any kids, or even any other human’s face in your profile pics.

I (42m) have some great pics of me dancing next to my best friends’ daughter, and she’s laughing and jumping. The girl’s mom sent it to me and said “use this in your dating apps!” To me it’s a way to signal that I’m great with kids, and I’m open to starting or joining a family with kids in it.

But people act like this is either wildly inappropriate or manipulative. And truly, I don’t get it. When I see a woman’s profile with pictures of her kids, I like it, and I try to imagine if I could be in that picture one day. What am I missing??",,18,96,2025-03-13 21:13:39

datingoverthirty,Naive about relationships,"Hello! I (35F) have come to the conclusion that I'm very naive and inexperienced with men and relationships.  In the last 15 years, I've had 
1. 10 year relationship that ended in divorce. 
 2. A 2 month relationship 
 3. A 3.5 month relationship. 

I've done some dating in between but feel like it's a waste of time because I'd rather do something fun like bike riding, work, or hiking.  
Most men seem to want casual and I just don't do that.  I know how to be married.  I don't know how to date. I have had men want a commited relationship but I wasn't ready. 

Even those relationships that only lasted a couple months hit me really hard because I just jumped all in. Fell in love hard and it took me years to get over them. 

I've done/am doing therapy,  have a great career, make good money, and I'm happy. I do want to learn how to be patient and not go all in and then not try again for a couple of years.

datingoverthirty,What is the line between adult problem solving and therapist?,"I am a natural problem solver so I have trouble commiserating with people. My motto in life has always been, ""if you don't like it, fix it"" and I struggle with people who talk about the same issues all the time without solving the problem since I can't relate.

Despite that I am fairly laid back and don't mind helping people through tough times or communicating goals or how to get to them. I've found if I let things work themselves out I often don't need to add extra energy to anything and, as someone who is coming out of a long-term physical disability, letting things go has been crucial to my overall health.

It has taken a WHILE to get good at saying ""wow I'm so sorry that's awful, what are you going to do?"" instead of ""have you tried...""

Lately I've noticed my dates needing a lot of emotional energy from me to help them fix their problems or talk about their options -- things like, buying a new car or how they're investing their tax refund, or their struggle with their parents. This is fine when it's friends but if I've been on three dates with someone, it feels like I should send a Venmo request for a therapist session.

But now I am running into people who have no problem getting into the serious trauma they experienced and wanting to give me every detail and insight, which they sometimes refer to their current state and say something to the effect of, ""and that's why I have the attachment style I do"" 

Is this just the state of 30-somethings? Am I exhibiting some sort of unknown attachment style by not wanting to know every single intimate detail of someone I have known for less than six months?

Most importantly, what attracts people who trauma dump? Is it resting friendly face? Attention?",,86,59,2025-03-11 16:39:46

datingoverthirty,Says he’s anxious,"31 F, 34 M 

Friends for almost 20 years. Recent developments in coming out of the friendzone. He pursued me like crazy and I finally gave in early this year. From there he took me on a date once / or twice a week. I wasn’t entirely ready but he assured me that it wouldn’t affect our friendship if things didn’t work out. I finally let my walls down. We slept together 2 weeks ago and communication dropped. He still talks to me every day but way less. I saw him Monday, had sex again (I initiated) he hasn’t hit me up for any booty calls and we had a talk and he basically said he wasn’t ready to commit and he feels anxious thinking about a relationship. He says he needs to focus on work because there is a big test coming up. 
Did I read the room wrong and just got played? Or is there a chance things can work out after his test when he’s less stressed? I’m confused because he did everything right and super communicative until we had sex 😭 he even got me gifts and small thoughtful things and purposely got time off for Valentine’s Day. 
He also had a traumatic childhood. He mentioned that he was scared to put down his walls and he has a hard time leaning on people. Maybe I’m reading too much into it but I feel like he has some sort of avoidant type attachment and the more invested he is the more scared he got.

datingoverthirty,"Monogamous people who multi-date in the early stages, could you share your experience?","I've been working on keeping my options open and dating multiple people in the early stages of dating while I ultimately look for my life partner.

By ""early stages"" I mean you have not yet had the exclusivity talk with anyone you're dating.

Those of you who have experience with this approach:

What do you say to a date when they ask what you're looking for?

How do you navigate sex? Is it OK to (safely) have sex with multiple people?

Have you had a date react poorly if they find out you're seeing other people?

What happens if you remain interested in more than one person for an extended amount of time? Do you feel like there's a time limit to decide?

datingoverthirty,Really bizarre interactions with a male friend of 8 years that I can't decide if it's interest or not?,"I (F33) met a guy (M36) in our mid/late 20s on tinder (I was 26 when we met, he was 29). We went on a handful of dates, things were intense but ended abruptly due to him being an avoidant person, both of us having clinical rotations in our respective specialties, and that was that.

The last time I saw him in person, was 2017, when we carpooled on an 8 hour roadtrip a few months after our whirlwind, and he dropped me off at my car and I told him, ""I kind of want to kiss you"". **He freaked out and said, ""BUT, the implications!!!""** Did NOT kiss me, got in his car and left. And that was it.

We didn't talk for a couple years, I've gone on to have multiple long term relationships, meanwhile he has always said he wanted one and and actively dates and has sex, but never has had a relationship. We somehow in the last 8 years became friends, and he is the one who usually reaches out. There have been elements of real friendship--he was the only one to call and check on me when I failed my boards. I was the one to send him the box of homemade Christmas cookies. He was the one to call me crying when his dog was hit by a car. I hate him, and yet I don't. And every year, or every few months, he usually reaches out about something else, but often during the convo asks ""Are you seeing anyone?"" (to which the answer is often yes).

During one of these recent episodes, over the holidays, we were texting about other things and he said, ""I'm an idiot. I should have picked you up that day and made out with you against the car"". I was dating someone during this conversation, so I told him point blank, ""Stand down, don't cross the line.""

I recently ended things with the guy i'd been seeing. My friend and I are having one of our typical text exchanges. For once, I'm single, so i finally can ask. I said to him: ""Why do you act like you like me, and then I flirt back, and you get cold?"" Him: ""sorry."" Me: ""Does this confirm or deny my suspicion--You have some feelings, and it's not just you joking?"" His reply: ""I got lots of jokes."" And then he vanished again.

People of the reddit. I am very confused. If you've ever stayed friends with a woman you briefly dated many years ago, for many many years after, and sent texts like that--what is this? Him jerking my chain? He has vanished, but i assume he will resurface again in a few days.

TL;DR: Friend of 8 years who i briefly dated blows hot and cold. Asked if he was interested, got another weird response. What to make of that intent? Not that it matters, but I am genuinely curious.",,50,107,2025-03-05 14:04:52
datingoverthirty,"Committed, but he says he is scared. Next Steps?","Edit: Thank you all for your advice. It seems I have a lot to think about. 

I (33F) have been seeing my amazing man (33M) for 4 months now, and life is truly amazing with him. I am just so happy! He is supportive, kind, communicative, funny and frankly, the man of my dreams. He includes me in his future plans, but we also talk and plan of our future together. We’ve met each other’s family and friends and both sides love what him and I are building. I’m in love with him. 

Around 2 months in, I communicated that I may be falling in love. He was receptive but said that he wasn’t quite where I was, that he needed some time to get to my level. His reasons were valid but he also mentioned that _he wanted to get to know me more because he is scared of making the wrong decision_. I don’t know what the wrong decision was, but it seems it was jumping in too quickly. I understood his position and things continued amazingly. 

We’re now approaching 4.5 months and the conversation came back on the table yesterday. This is some of what he said, _I'm not going to lie, I feel like I can see a future where we're happy together, but I'm scared! I'm committed to us, to you, and to our relationship, but I honestly still feel like I need more time. I would hate to get into something too early, and to have made the wrong decision_. I explained that if he’s still unsure then it wouldn’t be fair for him to drag me along while he figures it all out. I have been patient and I am also putting in effort in nurturing this beautiful thing that we are growing, but I also feel like I’m in relationship limbo. I need to protect my heart. Moreover, at this point, I’d hope for my man to be sure about me, trusting of their feelings and committed to seeing the relationship through. He says _he still requires more time to get to know me before making any big decisions_. He says he is committed to us, that we have an amazing connection and how I make him a better man and how he is truly happy with me. I understand all this but it also makes me nervous. 

Am I wrong to ask him to take the time to figure things out and maybe even see if there’s better for him? He is strongly opposed to this but I worry that he is scared because he feels he is settling for me when he could have better out there. My logic is that if he’s still unsure of me and wonders if it’s the right decision this far into being together, then it does not matter how good things are, they are bound to fail eventually. I need to guard my heart too and make decisions that are in my best interests. 

I welcome all perspective. Thank you. ",,84,159,2025-03-05 08:00:52

datingoverthirty,"How do you ""seriously date""?","I (34f) guess I'm back in the dating scene. I've been single for \~1.5 years after a very LTR though I am no stranger to dating casually, often with one thing on my mind! But now I think I'm interested in a more serious relationship. Here's my hang up: 

I don't understand the concept of meeting up with a perfect stranger and seeing if you two are compatible for a relationship. How would I know if you like me for me, or if you just want to be in a relationship (and all its benefits) and I simply check enough boxes for you? Is that not WILD to anyone else?

I guess I came out of a LTR where I felt he liked me ""enough"" to marry me but didn't actually \*know\* me. He didn't pay attention to my little quirks, or if I made a certain face it meant I was x, y, or z. He never thought of the ""little things,"" and there was nothing about ME that he was in love with. He just liked what I could do for him. How I made him feel. How I could benefit his life. If you asked him what he loved about me, every answer would be about him. ""She makes me feel this way. She does this for me."" Nothing about ME. (I was very, very young when I got married and he was my first real relationship.)

I am trying really hard to avoid that in the future. So how on earth do you avoid that when you meet a stranger with the potential of dating them? I feel like I would need to be friends with someone for awhile to know that they really care about me as a person, enjoy being around me as a person, and then if we both get to a place of ""I really like YOU, I want to show you my appreciation for you and everything you encompass by committing to a romantic relationship with you,"" THEN dating makes sense to me. I don't know how super realistic that is? But I just don't like the idea of finding a ""compatible enough"" person to date and then learning to like certain things about them over time.

Does anyone know what I'm talking about or can relate lol? How do you know if someone is dating you for YOU and not because they want to be in a relationship??",,186,119,2025-03-04 17:27:12
datingoverthirty,Where to go from here,"I (38F) asked a co-worker for his number (40M) and he gave it to me. 

Some back story, we had matched online years ago. I realized about a year ago, but had no clue if he was attached in the several years from matching to then. We rarely see each other and don’t work in the same space or have any direct contact. A few weeks ago an opportunity presented itself and I mentioned to him that I recalled us matching a few years ago and just wanted to mention it in case he also did. He said he didn’t, that he was no longer online but I got the impression he was interested. I left it for a few weeks and then asked for his number, which he gave without hesitation. 

Since then we’ve exchanged a few messages. He is a very quiet dude, so unsurprisingly, texting isn’t really happening. I asked if he’d like to go for a walk/coffee, but he had prior commitments. Nothing has been discussed since then. We’ve sent maybe 16 messages over a week. 

We have both been single for a significant period of time. I’m not overly fussed about a relationship, and gather he isn’t as well, which in a weird way, is making me more interested at the lack of interest. 

I have no idea what I’m looking for here typing this out. I guess I’ve just been out of it for so long that I don’t even really know how to proceed, if I even do at all. My go to is just to say forget it and stay happily single, but clearly this guy has been around the outside of my life for a few years and I feel like opportunities are presenting that haven’t so maybe it’s the time to do something more?

datingoverthirty,Not interested beyond flirting?,"Hello everyone,
I (34F) have been away from dating for about 2 years. I met this guy (30m) and we hit it off went on 2 wonderful dates where he kept complimenting me, saying he would like to do x w y with me, that he liked me etc. There was a lot of sexual tension in the second one. We even said that on the 3rd date we will go to someone's home.
He did mention in the last date that for the last year he was in a weird phase, where he flirted but it didn't go beyond that, as he was content with just that, but he said he wasn't in that phase anymore. He just said he wanted to me clear with me.
Lo and behold, he texts me couple days after the date that he does not wish to continue, and that he is sorry.
It is fine it was just 2 dates, but it is so bizarre.. I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this? Or how to deal with that kind of rejection... Anything will be appreciated. Thanks!",,57,65,2025-03-04 07:44:56

datingoverthirty,Odd encounter leaving me puzzled,"I (38F) met a guy (40+M) over the weekend at a friend's housewarming. I felt immediate chemistry with him which is very rare for me, and as the evening went on, we spoke quite a bit, and after the party, decided to make the commute back to our city together (alone). Things felt really good and there was natural flow of convo etc. When we got back to our city, he asked if I'd like to have drinks somewhere. Yay, great sign. We ended up drinking & chatting for 4 hours at a bar until they closed up. He waited with me for my taxi and asked for my number. Yay, another great sign. We hugged goodnight and that was that! 

The moment I got into the taxi, he texted me that he ""had a really great time hanging out, etc. and that it was really nice to meet you"". I thought this was a little odd as the way the night had gone, I had expected him to mention that he'd love to do it again soon etc. So I decided to make my interest clear by responding ""Yes it was so nice tonight, let me know if you want to hang out again :)"" And... he responded with.... ""Yeah that would be cool""

.... A really dry, disinterested response in my opinion. It's left me confused!! It sounds like he's closing the door... but why did he even bother asking for my number before I left? Was he just being polite? Yes I know I could ask him and only he would know the reason, but I don't wanna be one of those girls that can't take a hint. I think his message of disinterest in me is loud & clear. Just wondering if anyone has any similar encounter or insight. I'm feeling kinda disappointed as it's not often I share chemistry like that with someone.",,0,41,2025-03-03 14:52:39
datingoverthirty,Red flag: Insisting on exchanging numbers/ social media before the first date,"I’ve made my opinion of it known in more than a few comments in the daily threads. 

Most people who have asked me were respectful of my no, but when they weren’t, I would unmatch. I knew it to be red flag behavior. Why? Because before I wised up, every time I gave in to someone wanting my phone number or social media before meeting in person, one of two things would happen: 

1. No date would materialize. They would just lurk on my social media or text me when it was clear they were bored. I would finally block them out of annoyance. This was most common. They wanted more access to/information on me without making the effort to get to know me. Think of everything that’s on your social media— photos, pages you follow, friends/family. 

2. There was a date and they pushed my boundaries in some other way, usually with physical intimacy. I ended up in a more unpleasant situation because I was afraid of disappointing someone I barely knew. 

There’s absolutely no reason to *insist* on moving off the app before meeting in person that doesn’t amount to someone being entitled, lazy, dangerous, or all of the above. Apps have not just texting but video and voice capability now. Please don’t be fooled by people claiming the app is buggy or that they’re “never on it”. It worked long enough and they were on it long enough to match with you, and start a conversation. So they can stay on it with you until after you meet.

datingoverthirty,Why go with the flow if I know what I want,"Y’all- So id been seeing this guy for about a month (met in Jan) and everything was going so well. One night he calls me to let me know that his job will be taking him out of state come summer- so June or July. We talked about it over the phone for a bit and decided to keep seeing each other but apparently we were speaking two different languages because we talked about it again tonight and I’m feeling like I’m still in shock over the outcome. 

I basically told him that I know it’s very early but that I wanted to keep seeing each other if he’s open to the idea that we can treat his move as nothing more than a barrier if we find that our relationship has started to get serious and we aren’t ready to cut it off simply because there are logistics that have to be solved for. Where my head was/is- is that what I want more than anything is love and for the right person, I’m not closed off to moving or splitting my time between states for awhile. 


He was kind of all over the place between just wanting to keep things casual, while also acknowledging he wanted something serious, while also saying that he thinks it’s just a good idea if he focuses on his career for a few more years (which would take him nearly into his mid 40’s), while also saying he has a fear of commitment, while also saying he could tell that we had a good thing going on. 


I just. Part of me is frustrated because I wish I was a person that could just gO wITH tHe dEluSioNaL flow and enjoy time with him and just let him give me whatever love he has the capacity for. Part of me is glad I nixed this now to avoid emotionally investing in someone who was never gonna be serious. 

I wanna hear everyone’s thoughts and opinions on ‘going with the flow’. Do you do it- why or why not. How has the flow ended for you in the past?

datingoverthirty,Second date dilemma,"I (30F) have never had a boyfriend. I would go on a couple dates a year up until last year when I really tried to put more effort in. I only went on 8 first dates last year, but it was a huge step for me and my anxiety around dating. There was one date I went on that I really liked him but I never heard back. 

This year I’m still trying to make effort but I’m loosing all my energy. I go on dates and they’re just… FINE! I still am thoughtful about who I go out with, so they’re all nice and respectful and ambitious but there’s just nothing there. The conversations aren’t fun and feel full of effort and I never know what to do next. I understand giving people more chances, but when the conversation feels forced, is it even worth it? Anyone I’ve dated for multiple months I have known from the first date that I really liked them and giving people a second date has never really changed anything for me? 

Would love to hear more about how people decide who to give more chances to? And if you have truly ever found that you go from feeling completely unexcited to actually interested in them?

datingoverthirty,"Met this great girl on Valentine's Day, but she won't return my attempts to communicate with her. What could I have done better?"," I’m posting this mostly out of frustration/to vent, but I’m also hoping that I find some sort of silver lining, or learn from my apparent failure.



 Before I start, I feel that I should first disclose that 

1. I’m 34M 
2. I’ve never had a relationship, still a virgin, never kissed someone, etc., so I’m very inexperienced with dating/courtship/flirting. 
3. I have Asperger’s Syndrome and ADHD, which has negatively impacted my confidence towards pursuing women in the first place. I’m getting over this now, and give less of a damn about what others might think of me. But in my high school and college years, I blew every opportunity I had.
4. I don’t have a car (I wrecked mine a couple of years ago), and because I expect car prices to go up, I’m not sure that I will anytime soon, even if I start saving up specifically for that reason. There’s also my mom’s fear that I might kill myself, meaning that even if I do, I likely won’t be driving very far anytime soon. 
5. I live in Ocoee, Florida, where public transportation is crap, and rideshares are priced as a luxury.  
6. I live with my parents. That is another thing I’m unlikely to be able to change anytime soon, due to rent being so expensive, and having few, if any friends to potentially rent with.
7. I make money from three sources: working part time at a supermarket chain, on and off for a friend's start-up social media/game company, and from Social Security.
8. I’m trying to change all of that, by working on an art commission business illustrating pet portraits. I expect that it will take several months to actually go somewhere.



 None of this came up in conversation with the woman that is relevant to the conversation, so unless she was secretly telepathic, it wouldn’t make a difference. It's just frustrating because I got stonewalled even before any of that came up.

  

 I’m aware that for most women, these could be deal-breakers, and could drastically reduce my dating pool. I’m still trying, because 



1. I’m tired of feeling jealous and envious of guys who do have a girlfriend, when I’ve never had one. The tabloids and love songs do not help.
2. I do have a want, and indeed a need, to share love and affection with someone. I assume that this is a perfectly healthy need for most human beings, and that I’m not crazy, needy, or any of that nonsense. 



At the very least, I should have the following currently going for me:



1. I work out at least once a week. I don’t have big, muscular arms, a big chest, or a six pack, but at least I’m trying to keep myself in shape. I might be balding, but I’ve recently started compensating for that by keeping what hair I do have left very short, and I’m arguably in better shape than I was in my teens or 20s.
2. I’ve attempted to hang onto my sense of humor, even though it can be at times dry. Hopefully, some of that shows up in my writing here, and makes someone chuckle.
3. I keep trying to improve myself in various other ways.
4. I keep trying to be a decent human being.
5. I have friends and family helping me with my art business, so I know I’ll get there eventually, as long as I keep putting in the work.



 With that out of the way, onto Valentine's night, when I thought I finally met someone at a mixer I went to. This was the first time I tried something like this, and honestly didn’t know how things would turn out.



 I talked to many other girls of many different shapes, sizes, and personalities, but there was only one who I felt attracted to. When she caught me looking at her, she said hello, and we immediately introduced one another. When she said that she loved science fiction, I flirtingly said something along the lines that if she also loves roller coasters, I might start to fall for her. When she mentioned that she was on that roller coaster in Abu Dhabi at Ferrari Land, one of the fastest launch coasters on the planet, and also said that she loved traveling and visiting National Parks, I knew that I was falling for her the more that I listened to her talk. What’s more, she had an outstanding body, and I was thinking that I not only had a potential ride buddy and travel partner, but also a work-out buddy who would give me the additional motivation and push to keep improving my body. She was checking off every single box on my list. 



 Eventually I decided to wander off to try to find someone else to talk to as she showed a growing interest in talking to other people, which looking back now, should have been a warning sign that she was not interested in reciprocating, in spite of the fact that we had a lot of things in common, and from what I could tell, should have had potential to make a good couple, at least on paper. 



 I actually thought I had a pretty good shot with her when she had me kiss her good night on the cheek, and when I asked her about doing some rides together, she apparently agreed, and gave me a card with her number. I also told her about a trip that I was doing with a friend to King’s Dominion in June, and whether she might be interested. She asked me about my friend, and I told her that my friend was cursed with motion sickness, and that I’d very much love a shotgun rider, to which she laughed.



 As she left, I jumped up excitedly. I felt pretty proud of myself at the time. I not only held myself in multiple conversations with strangers, something I’ve struggled with due to being socially shy, and on top of that, I met this wonderful girl. This was the happiest that I’d been in a while, and I thought that I finally met at least my first future girlfriend. Or so I thought.



 I tried calling her on Sunday night, but she didn’t answer, so I left a message. She never responded, so I left a text for her yesterday morning. I spent the rest of the day trying to just get her off my mind, starting work on a pet portrait for my cousin while listening to videos on Youtube about the paranormal. Even though we like so many of the same things, I guess that wasn’t enough for her.



 



 Looking back now, I’m trying to figure out where the hell I went wrong.



1. Inviting her on my trip with a friend too soon, and mistakenly assuming that she mutually felt the same connection I felt to her?
2. My response to her saying “see you later” being a joking “sooner than you think” as she left?
3. Not calling or texting her the next day (even though I was really busy that day)?
4. Not sounding confident in the voice message I left her on Sunday night after getting home from work (I didn’t know how to alter it, and I figured “what harm could it cause”?
5. Asking if she liked automobiles, and mentioning this car show that they do at Old Town on certain days (it’s at the same place I was thinking of going out to anyways)?



  I have the faint hope that maybe she’ll surprise me, but at this point, I’m just trying to accept the fact that she rejected me, and move on. I’m not going to lie though, I’m not taking it well, and the next time that a girl gives me her number, I’m probably going to ask if she really wants me to contact her, or just to avoid conflict. I don’t want to get excited about going out with someone who doesn’t feel the same way, only to get hurt like this again. And anyone else who has had their heart broken must feel where I’m coming from, decorum be damned.



 I’d much rather that someone tell me “well, if you didn’t say X, or if you had Y, maybe I would have had a different answer”, and work on that, rather than be lied to.



 And yes, I’m very sensitive, even without my Asperger’s Syndrome, and ADHD, let alone my terrible experience with attempting to date. The first time, I fell in love with a cat-fisher, and rather than lose my single status and possibly my virginity, I nearly got scammed, and lost a not-insignificant amount of faith in people online, and humanity in general, not to mention having my heart broken, which hasn’t really recovered ever since.

 The next two girls were prioritizing their careers, and just not interested in a romantic relationship. The second one especially hurt, since we had a lot in common, and I loved spending time with her, but I take some comfort that we are at least on good terms, and I still care for her. The most recent girl was interested in a romantic relationship, but didn’t want to move onto a second date, because she was moving away to Wisconsin. If not for that, it would have been a perfect first date, and provided so much potential for the future. Accepting this was particularly painful, but always wanting to end things on a positive note, I wished her the best.



 But all of this has led to me feeling constantly frustrated, and jaded and jealous towards men who have lucked out, and have a girl of their own, especially post-Valentines Day. And I hate, *hate*, ***hate***, feeling so negative about the subject of dating and relationships.



 I *loved* how I felt on Saturday and Sunday, and how I felt looking forward to seeing this girl again, and getting to know her better. I ***loved*** daydreaming about what the future would look like with her, and thinking about what adventures we could go on, even on a very modest budget. And I feel that everyone should always have the opportunity to feel that way (at least those who would treat their SO like a human being). I was going to teasingly ask her what a girl like her was still doing single. After all, she was about my age, and most girls even younger than me are already in a relationship, if not married. Now I’m starting to suspect why.



 And I don’t think it’s asking for too much to want someone special who shares many of the same interests, and who I can take with me to Virginia and Washington D.C. in June, although it seems that life has just told me otherwise. It’s not like there won’t be millions of couples all over the world doing something similar, many far younger than me.



 And from being single for so long, I’ve had plenty of time to do soul-searching, and I’ve decided that **just sex** ***is*** **NOT** going to satisfy me. What I crave is **mutual intimacy, love, and affection**.  



  Even if some girl I met at a bar offered to take me home with her, I doubt I’d feel satisfied after her brief time in my life is over, and would probably constantly wish that she were my soulmate instead of just a one-night stand. I also wouldn’t like the friction this would create with my mom, who would be worried sick if I went home with a stranger like that, even though I guess millions of people do it every night. For those of you who live on their own: yes, it has its challenges, but it’s also a blessing too.

  


 I’ll admit that I’m posting all of this (and I apologize for how long it is!) in hopes that there is some other soul who has gone through and understands my heartache and loneliness, and would be willing and able to help. 



 I’m also posting this in the faint hope that maybe there are some lady on here who shares the same passions I do, and has had the opposite problem of meeting too many lousy men more interested in their chest and looks, than in the soul said to reside in their chest, and the huge, lovely organ sitting behind their face that gives them their personality and thoughts. And doesn’t mind my wry sense of humor. Even better if it makes them laugh.



 **I don’t expect that to happen.**



 I’d even settle for anyone who is just interested in doing the same things that I love to do. On the bright side, I’d only have to pay for myself. I’ve kind of already posted on Reddit and Facebook to see if there is anyone who might be interested in meeting at King’s Dominion in June, and I’m proud to say that I have gotten some responses that have been positive, so at least that part of the trip will be a little more fun. And when I get back, I would love to have friends to go to one of the parks after I get back.



 **Again, I’m not expecting that to happen either.** In my experience, life just doesn’t hand you things of that importance. If my experience is anything to go by, life seems to be determined to make this like pulling teeth. Given how some men just can’t tolerate being rejected, it’s a little understandable, but extremely frustrating for people like me who prefer not to overcomplicate things.



 I intend to continue finding and going to social meet-ups, because I feel that is the best way to get over this and move on, rather than giving the emptiness inside and the depression a chance to grow. When I’m bored at my job at a supermarket, and see a couple walk into my lane, I’d much rather think how I’m going to be like one of those lucky guys, rather than ruminate how unfair it is that I have nobody to love. As of now, I’m going to a social meet-up this Saturday. I don’t expect to find a date there, but I do at least intend to see if I can find any women in my age bracket, and try to have some fun flirting.  



 And before anybody suggests therapy/calls me crazy, yes, I’ve thought about finding therapy for my very specific condition. Unless it would help me stop being involuntarily single, it wouldn’t help me at all.

datingoverthirty,Dealing with rejection as we get older,"So I (31M) met a wonderful (mid-20s F) on holiday. We were both visiting the same country and met randomly, hit it off, and hung out the rest of the evening. We swapped numbers and she seemed very interested in at least meeting up one more time before going home.

I sent a short ""Hey I had a wonderful time meeting you, if you're free for drinks tomorrow night would love to meet up again!""

Well almost 40 hours later, I assume she's not interested. Which is frustrating and it's compounding the confidence issues I'm already having from my last long term relationship ending.

I don't necessarily think I did anything wrong, just confused. How are others dealing with it? How do you continue to even try? Every time I go out on a limb and it doesn't work, it makes me question but I have a clock ticking in my head that I'll die alone and by myself.

datingoverthirty,Looking for feedback on this crazy situation!,"So, I’m looking for feedback because this situation is insane and I can’t wrap my head around it. I feel traumatized, ngl. So, I was talking to this guy from Eastern Europe briefly ,”A.” Like 3 dates over 4 weeks. Then I found out that he’s married back home and cut things off. He lied about it and the lie isn’t what hurt, it’s that he lied to try to take away my choice in what kind of situation I’m engaged in. He was totally unapologetic and just like “tee hee, you got me!” The break was oddly amicable as I was just done. Maybe a month passes and he shows up at a place I frequent, that is out of his way, and he does not like of have any interest in as he’s expressed prior. However, if you ever want to find me, you’ll find me there. I know everyone there. They were having a singles event that night. First time ever. We saw each other, didn’t speak just like strangers which is fine. Then I noticed A hitting on  girl after girl. Again, I know 90% of the people there. So when the opportunity rose, I would let the girls that I know know like “hey girlie, do what you want but just fyi he is def married.” I could have kept my mouth shut. On the other hand, I felt like, I don’t want him to do what he did to me to others. If they are down for being involved with a married man- that’s their choice. Their choice. Every time the girls were like “omg ew, thanks!” And would disengage when A would circle back to them. 

 Later, I was mingling, not flirting. Just having a conversation with a guy I don’t know (B). No sexy vibes at all. Talking about work (he is working to get in the field I am in,) and hobbies with a stranger. So A comes up to B not one, two but 3 times and is in B’s face. The last time, B was like “what’s the problem?” And A was like let’s go outside. Long story short, I was like “can we not?!?” Saw when B knocked A unconscious with one punch, and panicked. I was scared for everyone involved. I went back in the venue looking for my bestie for help and she was like “girl we gotta go, now!!!” When we got outside A and B were talking chilling. They came up to us saying “we’re all good and fist bumping. I however am now shaking, way over stimulated, having a pretty bad trauma response. I was stuttering and my decision making was on pause. All I know is to follow my friend, my friend is safe. So my friend was like “don’t talk to her just keep it moving.” B looked at me like kind of disappointed and was like um ok… A however stopped in front of me, points to his busted and bloodied face and goes “this is your fault and walks away.” 

My friend and I spent the night debriefing on her sofa. But it’s wracking my brain. I don’t understand AT ALL what happened. None of my friends can explain it to me, everyone seems baffled. They all insist it’s not my fault, but I feel like it was, but I don’t understand why. HELP! 

It’s wracking my brain. Wtf happened?!?! Why was he there? It’s a niche place he doesn’t like and is far from his house. He never goes there. If he was mad at me, why not pull me to the side and be like “please don’t tell girls I’m married.” Would it have worked? Idk. Why pick a fight with a rando that he (and I) had never seen before? There was NOTHING suggestive about our body language or anything, so jealousy doesn’t make sense. When he came up we were literally talking about my career field and I was giving advice on how to approach his program. We split amicably had no contact in a month, and he is MARRIED, so there’s no “I want you back” vibes. He risked his life picking a fight with a stranger, he could’ve got shot, jumped, stabbed, anything. And for what? Then to look at me after regaining consciousness and say it’s my fault is wild. I’ve seen a lot but NEVER this type of shit. 

Can someone make this make sense to me? In retrospect, I’m sure he was at least annoyed that I was giving girls the heads up about him. I could have minded my business, but I was so triggered at the thought of him doing to them what he did to me. I felt like they should be able to make an informed decision about what they get into. Honestly, I was surprised they all were like “ew” bc some of them I know for sure don’t care. He has a lot of money and they’d ride him and that gravy train for as long as possible. But again, as an informed choice- not through deception. 

I understand B being like “ok let’s go.” The guy was a stranger with ill will, so yes, you can leave, but I can understand being like “ok let’s get it” if you have the training and would rather be in open confrontation than sucker punched or jumped or shot while trying to get to your car and leave.  

I don’t understand why A picked the fight with B. I don’t understand why it’s my “fault.” Like, A could have easily been like “oh that’s a scorned ex she’s lying”… granted he was def wearing his wedding ring which is WILD. He could have said he’s a widower. He could have lied to them and said they have an open relationship. His wife is abroad. They’d never know different. He could have been like “girl, stop. Don’t cramp my style.” He could’ve told the staff that I was stirring shit up. I know them all but they would’ve been like “girl chill.” And I would’ve listened. I really do not so deep down feel conflicted bc I feel like it is my fault, but I don’t feel bad for warning other women. I feel bad/conflicted that it went to that point. I’m glad B didn’t get hurt bc he was innocent but I feel weird that he looked disappointed in me at the end. Like, what did A tell him? I feel like I’m still triggered. It’s giving vibes like when I was with my very abusive ex and he would physically hurt me and say it’s my fault. He would steal my car, use my savings, just life consequences would happen to him and it would be my fault.

datingoverthirty,VDay Avoidance after a few months of Dating,"I've been lurking this sub and I'm surprised no one is talking about Valentines Day. I've been single for 15yrs and I'm a little shocked bc I thought couples took this more seriously. Was I mistaken?

Been dating someone for a few months and they're not into the holiday. Since I've been single for so long and haven't been dating anyone during this time of year, I've never really had to deal with it aside from just trying to show myself love. So, I could never gauge how I truly felt about it.

The guy I'm dating doesn't care for it and is recently out of a LTR. I expressed that I would like flowers and he told that he'd need more time to get me flowers. That he didn't like being pressured to buy gifts because it's a holiday. And I lowkey crashed out at dinner because there have been many things I've done in the last few months that probably should've taken more time but I was trying to be open and not so tied to my ""rules"". I was honestly offended that flowers is where he drew the line. He commented on how much my mood switched up and said I didn't say I would never get you them...zi would just rather I got them when I really wanted to get them for you and not some holiday. We've barely spoken this week and there are no plans for this weekend and idk I'm trying to figure out if this is the end of it. He finally called me when I was out for a work HH but was likely sleep when I called back.

I don't want to put so much stake in a ""capitalist/superficial"" holiday but at the same time I would like a partner who is receptive to my needs and is willing to meet them - especially if it doesn't directly interfere with their boundaries and puts them in a position where self abandonment is the only option to keep the peace.

I guess, my question is - if you were dating someone for a few months and they essentially dismissed your feelings around V-Day and straight up ignored the holiday what would you take from that? How would you move forward? Considering that you know it's a silly holiday but you also have feelings about being shown you're loved and cared for and your happiness and satisfaction is a priority for your lover.

2/15 UPDATE: I have to say that I am genuinely overwhelmed by the amount of sage advice many of you have shared - not just for me, but for anyone who is feeling like their needs are going dismissed and unmet in all stages of relationship. I'm sure there will continue to be folx who think I am asking for too much or overreacting, and that's fine too. It's taken me a lot of healing to even get to a place where I can state what it is that I want and explicitly communicate how it is I want to be treated. More than anything, this relationship has shown me that it is not hard for me to do, but rather that I will likely get resistance...from the WRONG person. While I'm sad to have not had the kind of long Valentine's Day weekend I would have liked, I am grateful for the clarity, AND realization that I have grown so much in my healing that I am not as distressed about this as this post may otherwise indicate. I will continue to peruse any incoming comments as I will likely come back to this often over the next little while as I work through this.",,197,303,2025-02-14 02:56:35
datingoverthirty,I dunno what to do here,"So a funny thing that has never happened to me, happened to me. I (M34) happily received some flirtatious vibes from a woman before and after a yoga class, after I sort of unintentionally broke the ice by offering a space for her. Some obvious, healthy flirts. 

I didn't get her number, and then I didn't see her at the other class we both frequent today. It will be Monday, a week later. I'm like a little embarrassed to ask for her number in front of all these yogi people, but I don't have another option.

datingoverthirty,Can We Talk About Questions.,"Tl;dr: Straight men, if you don't ask reciprocal questions, are you just not that interested? What do you want women to say/do instead?

Straight women, how do you engage with men on the apps who don't ask questions/don't seem to want to engage very much?



\-------------------------------

As someone who has been on and off the apps for years (and before that did and loved old-school online dating), I think I'm struggling more than ever with trying to get communication off the ground in the early stages.

I used to love long, dramatic conversations on OKC and that's how I met my original primary partner as well as many great humans over the year, but since becoming single-single in 2022, it feels harder than ever to 1) keep conversations going/enthusiastic in the early stages and 2) get people to get off the apps into real life.

My bias is that I like writing/language, and so I've tried to be really empathetic to the fact that most people are forced into text-based communication with these modern dating formats. I think back in the day online dating used to self-select for people who were more at ease with communicating via language, and now it's just everybody. But I'm not getting anywhere lately and figured I'd ask for other people's experiences/advice.

I get that not everyone is a conversationalist, but in the past, people who weren't amazing at talking on the apps used to more quickly just ask you out. Not sure if it's the weather being shitty, or a change in the culture, but I just feel like more conversations go absolutely nowhere very quickly.

At the moment, I have 5 conversations that are fading out b/c my approach has been to not reply when the person doesn't offer something that feels easy/relevant to reply to.

Ex. ""In bed bundled up."" ""I'm fine, going to get food.""

So I'm just curious if people are sort of pushing harder these days to create conversation? Is it old school to assume these people just aren't that interested in me? Are people using more dramatic conversation starters/have any tried and true ways of creating more fun conversations?",,119,134,2025-02-13 15:23:20

datingoverthirty,Would you be flattered or weirded out?,"I’m 37F and today at work, one of my close coworkers casually drops in conversation that his brother is single. I marinate on it for 3 hours then ask him to tell me more about his brother. In perfect “little brother” fashion says, a few nice things about the kind of parent and person he is. Then, he adds “he’s more of an asshole” … naturally I’m intrigued as I know my coworkers sense of humor. After work I looked him up, liked what I saw then sent my coworker a few good pics of myself and asked him to send the pics and see if his brother was comfortable exchanging numbers.

dating,"Sorry not sorry, but i’m tired of seeing people boil everything down to looks when it’s usually and most likely just their personality","Seriously, this rhetoric is so annoying. Have yall never been at a mall in the afternoon? At a park? Outside? Because you will see a variety of couples with different levels of “attractiveness” happily together. You see it all the damn time on social media too:

Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco

Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan

Lana Del Rey and Jack Donoghue 

Beyoncé and Jay-Z

Sniperwolf and Evan

And these people are all in the same tax bracket so no it’s not just a matter of looks and money 🙄. 

For some reason if you tell someone it’s their personality not their looks, they get defensive but it’s like… go outside and see for yourself. I see it all the damn time myself with my homegirls who date some people that genuinely look like they just walked onto earth, but guess what they did have? A great ass personality that trumped that. This defeatist mentality that women only go for the top 10% of men is so ridiculously funny when you can see it’s not true if you look around. 

People are getting knocked up by the bummiest of bum deadbeats who have nothing going for them at all… and a lot of the times it’s just because they have a way of being charismatic, funny, and appealing that doesn’t involve their looks.

I have met women almost same height or even taller than me being so nice to me when compared to the women short than me.

I have seen exceptions too for this, but makes me wonder what causes this behaviour ?
For example it's easy to spot a tall women with same height or shorter man than spotting a short women with short or even average height man.

Also I notice tall women don't care much about superficial things much and are more open to communicate even if you don't know them well.

She’ll start opening up to me about very personal stuff, stuff that I can’t begin to imagine going through, she’s opened up to me more than anyone else (her words not mine).

I always have just listened to what she has to say without giving much feedback. She talks about how people have been telling her how sorry they are for her, and she’s sick of being told that, so I just tell her that she’s heard. Which pisses her off really bad but idk what she wants me to say.

Yesterday she told me that if I made her feel overlooked one more time we were through. Idk what to do, we talked it out and went to bed on good terms, but it’s so scary to think that I have no more room for failure, and I don’t even think she knows what she wants to hear.

IDK what to do this feels so nice and we have long term plans made and everything just I cannot call him my boyfriend and be all gushy about it, and send him those cringe memes of ""my bf when"" We have also never said I love you but I do feel love for him, just I'm not ready for us to move onto ""I love you"" for now. 

What should I do???

dating,Haven’t even actively and exclusively dated anyone and the trust issues are piling up to never wanna date,"I have been off social media and was not talking to or seeing anyone for these past few months. When I went back recently, a guy I had been intimate with a couple of times reached out and we got to talking again. This kinda made me a bit excited to resume talking with someone I thought I had chemistry with in terms of physical intimacy, discussions, and humor despite both of us kind of not being our usual type. Back then, when we'd hooked up, i was in and out of the town a lot, and we had not established any exclusivity but had mentioned we were not exclusively seeing other people and neither of us is cheating on anyone. During that time, I had a feeling he was also talking to someone else, and a part of me had been hurt, but I knew it was irrational to feel hurt over fwb situation, and I was too preoccupied with work and family to be that bothered by it to completely cut contact or even question anything. I did get out of social media and we eventually drifted off since most of our contact was through sharing reels or snaps.

However, isolation got the best of me, and I ended up going back online, and he aproached me, we talked about this and that, and he offered to hangout and have drinks, which I had to decline because I was sick one time and busy the other. 
I didnt bring up if he was involved with someone because it didn’t make sense to me that someone exclusively involved with someone would like reach out and ask for drinks with sexual intentions, and honestly, I didn’t want to assume that was what he wanted. We’d share reels and I didnt think much of it that much other than people with similar humor sharing jokes, and I interact with a very few people, so it felt nice even to talk to someone who got my humor. Today he asked me if we could hang out and get drinks like before as in with hookup and all, and before I answered, I decided to stalk his profile. With a lil bit of digging, found out the girl from before (who he had been talking to) had posted photos of flowers in his apt on Feb 14. Not only that, the caption clearly indicates a serious relationship. I dug a bit deeper to find he had been in a dinner date with her 2 days ago, multiple story highlights of him in a Christmas vacation with her family, and comments suggesting that yes, that is an exclusive relationship. Worst part was she seems to be so much into him and seems so very sweet that I felt like a horrible person for not stalking and finding out ahead of time. I obviously declined, couldn’t disclose I know he is in a relationship through stalking, so told him I’m not looking for anything and am focusing on myself. It just left such a bitter taste in my mouth. 

Why do people do this? Like had I not looked into his tagged photos and such, I was feeling lonely enough to go meet him, without the slightest idea that I’d have been helping him cheat. Also looking back, had he been in a relationship the entire time? Like when we hooked up a few months ago? I’d not find any photos of that time but how to even trust an asshole like that. It also made me question how big of a side-chick and pick-me vibe I probably give off to be in such a situation. I’m not even dating and learning lessons that are adding upto my trust issues. Is this what majority of people are like? I watch so many of my friends be that girlfriend who keeps on forgiving their shitty partner for talking to or approaching other girls, and i feel lucky not to have been in their position despite also being lonely most of the time. Suffice to say, deleted my accounts again and back to my hole.
Edit: one reason i find this very upsetting is because while in college, the first guy i’d been with and fallen for had only disclosed of his involvement with someone else after things got too serious between us. Like he was involved with someone else when we first kissed and had sex and for weeks after that. This experience just triggers that stupid first heartbreak i think.",Just Venting 😮‍💨,9,13,2025-04-03 22:07:44
dating,A man lied about his age.,"I met a man at a nightclub, he approached me and we began talking about ourselves, he told me his age was 32 (I’m 23 and I have no issue with an age gap). 

He was really infatuated with me and asked for my details so I gave them to him. When I got home he had messaged saying how nice it was to meet me and that he wants to take me out on a date the very next day. On his social media it said he was a movie director.

The next day had come and he got us tickets to a screening of a film that hadn’t been released yet, we were one of the first people to view it. After this we went into the city and he offered to pay for every single little thing for me, he paid for me to eat, for my dessert, for us to do an activity, he even wanted to me an entire cake from his favourite cafe but I declined.

It was getting late so he walked me to my train station, it was cold that evening so he gave me his coat that was quite expensive and told me that I could keep it. He sat and cuddled with me until my train came, when it arrived he kissed and told me he couldn’t wait to see me again. 

A few days later he asked to see me again and when I said yes he completely disappeared. I thought it was really odd but I didn’t take it take to heart. 

A little bit of time went on and he randomly came across my mind, I got this weird instinct to google his name so I did. I discovered that one of the companies he owned had gone into administration, I found all the paper work for his companies and along side that I found his details. He originally told me that he was 32 years old so that means he would’ve been born in 1992 but his birth year said 1984, which makes him 40 years old.

I have nothing against an age gap but it’s just the fact that he lied to my face when I asked for his age. I feel really grateful I didn’t hear anything else after what was last said, he was sweet and generous but I just find it extremely weird that he lied about his age, it’s almost as if he lied to me because he didn’t want to scare me off about his age.",Just Venting 😮‍💨,78,84,2025-04-03 09:31:32

dating,Friend (18f) wants me (17m) to ask her to Prom,"Hi, I know this isn't typical dating advice as I am not currently dating anyone, but I was wondering if I could get some feedback from others, especially girls. I (17m) am currently a senior in high school and prom is in about a month. Last night, my sister (14f) told me that a girl in her grade told her that my friend Emily (fake name lol) (18f) wants me to ask her to prom. This kind of came out of nowhere to me.

Emily and this other girl are both on the varsity soccer team and apparently they were all talking about prom. Now Emily is my friend who I have known for six years. We are not bff's or anything and I only occasionally see her outside of school and school events so we know each other well but are not super close. She would always want to dance with me for one or two songs at dances in the past, but for her to apparently put it out there that she wants me to ask her to prom, I would just like to know how to read the situation. Obviously it could just be that she wants to go as friends as neither of us are in relationships and she would feel comfortable with me as her date in which case I would think she could just talk to me about in person, but it also could be that she wants more and I have been kind of thinking about it all day. I used to have feelings for her, but ""put them away"" myself a few years ago as I didn't think they were reciprocated so have just been viewing our relationship as two platonic friends. 

The other thing is I have been crushing a bit on a different girl, but the sudden realization that maybe Emily possibly has feelings has kind of flipped things on its head and has me in my feelings a bit. Does this seem like the behavior of someone harboring a crush? I plan on talking to Emily tomorrow when I see her, but if anyone has been in a similar situation or could give me any pointers I'd appreciate it.",I Need Advice 😩,10,32,2025-04-03 16:09:22
dating,Fraudulent dating sites (and what I did because of them),"There are lots of fraudulent dating sites on the internet. Example: you sign up and within a minute you get dozens of messages from profiles with pictures of which you think: they don't need a dating site! But before you can reply you must pay. Yeah, right...

The best way to punish a scammer is: offer the same thing for free. Call me a dreamer if you want, but I try to make this world a better place.

For that reason I decided to set up a new dating site that is different in more than one way:

1: it's 100% free

2: it's all-inclusive (straight or gay, cis or trans, handicapped or not... doesn't matter)

I can afford to do that as I already had more webspace than I needed and I could do all the programming myself (html, javascript and php). And it gives this retired man something to do.

And guess what... some people think it MUST be a scam because ""there is no such thing as free"". Guess what... This retired man wants to do the right thing and it gives levsomething to do. So yes, it is free!

Fortunately a fast growing number of people either trust my site or they say ""I'll try until I have to oay"" (meaning: they sign up successfully as it really is free). It has been up and running for just about 3 months and the number of members is growing faster everyday.

Last week we were working out next to each other and locked eyes and he made a joke about his grip strength being shit and I laughed and introduced myself etc. We chatted for a bit then left it at that

The issue is I’m into this man, and l want to get his number, or rather, I want him to ask haha. Every time we see each other we say hello but he always fist bumps me and I started doing it back because I don’t know just force of habit I guess. My friend who’s a gym rat says this is a bad sign that he’s friendzoning me

I know men are generally scared of approaching women at the gym for fear of being creepy etc, so I hyped myself up today and went up to him while resting mid sets and asked him how it’s going etc. So this is where it gets awkward. He puts out his fist to fist bump me and I said something along the lines of him being the only person to do that, at which he replies “do you want a hug?” and then I sort of gave him a half assed hug🫠 Chat am I cooked? 

I then asked him a question about an exercise and he was polite and answered and then we made small talk and I left. Still no number or nothing lol

He left for a wedding and due to a series of unfortunate events, I accused him of being unfaithful. He sent me a picture with a man holding a woman's leg, and had an exact picture with the same woman that looked like that on Facebook and was with her that night. It turns out it was his uncle. I apologized for that profusely and tried to make amends in different ways, but in all situations I was going to ask about the picture because it was suspicious to me. 

His tone changed a bit after the incident. 

We have met twice since then and his energy has been lower and he blamed me for a bunch of petty things on the date. He was upset that I said we should sit somewhere ""temperate"" instead of just saying ""inside"" or ""outside"". 

Then yesterday he called to break it off. He explained that that incident with the accusation put him off as he doesn't want a partner who could come to those conclusions, and that I don't actively engage with him when he voices problems. I explained I didn't know he was experiencing problems and hence didn't know how to help.

dating,What are your least favorite pieces of unhelpful dating advice?,"after being on this sub a little while i feel like most pieces of dating advice are just platitudes or in poor taste but what happens to be your least favorite?

here’s mine: “you need to cultivate intimate friendships, and then you won’t feel so lonely!”

yes it helps to have close relationships with friends and family. however in my experience as a nearly 31 year old, all of my “intimate friendships” have dwindled and become not so intimate because guess what, all these friends of mine are busy spending time with their own partners. it’s good to have friends but they will never fill the hole that a genuine partner could. it’s also the natural progression of things that your friends will choose to spend time with their partners and the families they create themselves over you. like all my friends have partners, even the ones with whom i’d say i have close relationships with. and how it goes is that i barely see them these days because they spend their time with their partners. why is it so bad to want the same thing?

and let’s say you do make some close friends and stuff, they probably aren’t going to be close for very long as they have to work and take care of their own business. and also if they’re single just like you, well that isn’t going to last forever. they’re probably looking for partners just like you.

i really dislike this one lmao i just feel like it’s dumb to tell people to substitute a partnership with friendships. especially as an adult where that kind of thing is difficult to cultivate and even harder to maintain. life is not a sitcom. you might as well put in effort to try and find a partner if it’s going to take a lot of effort to make friends anyway. 

btw i think it’s so wild when i was on the dating apps and there were people being like “i have a partner but i’m just on here for friends” and it’s like???? how do you find a partner before having any friends ? idk i make friends pretty easily. but i want a real partner. rant over, discuss lol",Question ❓,40,71,2025-04-02 21:53:49
dating,Dating and OCD,"To preface I (21M heterosexual) want to make it clear that I have diagnosed OCD, so when I say OCD I’m not talking about being super organised or washing hands or whatever other stereotype. To those who don’t know, in a nutshell, OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) is a psychological condition which causes you to obsessively think about something and sometimes compulsively perform “rituals” for lack of a better term to alleviate said thoughts. The obsessions caused by OCD are often irrational and those who suffer it are aware of this, but our brains keep telling us that some horrifying fate awaits us if we don’t somehow address these obsessive thoughts which we ourselves don’t understand. 

Personally, my symptoms are currently mild but in the past were much more debilitating, for example I would close and lock my door, but something in the back of my head would always tell me that the door was actually not properly closed and that an intruder would break into my home and steal all my stuff. I often would walk away from my door only to run back to it and push it to make sure it wouldn’t open, and I would have to repeat this multiple times before the thought subsided, all the while being fully aware of the fact that I had closed and locked it the first time. 

Now with that context out of the way I want to talk about how OCD impacts dating for me. I’m generally speaking quite extroverted and it’s easy for me to start conversations and get to know people. The problems begins when I actually start being interested in someone romantically. I will often start overanalysing everything I do or say and every moment of every interaction with the person I’m interested in and I end up stressing myself out immensely. This happens even when there’s nothing wrong, I could be on a date that’s going perfectly but still feel this way because my brain will do its best to find/fabricate evidence of how I messed something up. Because of this stress I tend to lose my confidence and become much more shy and awkward. I also end up frequently and repeatedly asking my friends or my cousin for their opinion on the situation, which I guess is the compulsive component of the disorder manifesting itself. In most cases of course people I ask say I didn’t mess up and I should just act natural and be myself but the OCD just doesn’t let me accept that answer even though I completely agree. In most cases, I just stop talking to my crush after a while because I can’t deal with the stress. I honestly wish that I could just keep being myself when I start liking someone and I know if I was I would honestly not have much trouble dating, but OCD often overpowers rational thoughts. 

I am aware there are treatments for OCD, these are usually SSRI antidepressants, but given the fact that other than what I have described here I don’t have debilitating symptoms like I described with the doors anymore I feel like the potential side effects don’t justify the gains, which is an opinion shared by my psychiatrist. For now, I am just trying my best to be myself, avoid stress and find ways to manage my symptoms better.

If you have any thoughts or similar experiences you want to share please do, but be aware that I’m not really seeking advice here since (as previously mentioned) I already know exactly what I need to do in theory, but I am ultimately hindered by my condition. I just needed to vent. ",Just Venting 😮‍💨,2,3,2025-04-03 13:24:15

dating,I got rejected by someone I had a lot in common with because I'm not putting my college degree to use,"
I'm a guy who struggles with socializing. I graduated college 7 years ago with a degree in Digital Filmmaking and only recently found out that the only real ideal way to get a job in what I want my career to be (video editor) is to network and make connections with people in the industry. I haven't had much luck in finding work in my field since graduating, only a few short term freelance jobs I got through family members, filming and editing a music video for my sister and filming and editing some videos for a business that is owned by someone my parents know.

I've never been in a relationship before but have been on dating apps on and off for a few years but I always felt like I really shouldn't try to date until I have my life where I want it, which is having the job I want and not the minimum wage retail job I currently have, so I haven't been on a dating app in a while.

I thought that might not be true and made an account on tinder recently and I matched with a girl. We had a lot in common in terms of hobbies (video editing, photography) and we both liked cartoons, and even were both liked a particular actor and knew him from a secondary character he played in a cartoon we both watched.

We were talking for a few days but I mentioned how I'm working a retail job and not having a career in what I majored in 7 years after graduating college. She said it seemed like we're in different places in life and that I don't have any goals or aspirations in life or if I do that I don't have the drive to achieve them. That she is also working a retail job but has things lined up to get her the career she wants. I mentioned being socially awkward and not knowing how to network and she said that's the stupidest thing she ever heard and that social skills can be improved and that this was goodbye.

It sucks to be rejected a second time by someone I had a lot in common with (we matched the year before and had been planning to hang out after taking for a few days but she unmatched me because she didn't like my facial hair style). Especially because I don't talk to many people in general because of my struggling with socializing (even though that's my own fault).

And I feel like it shows that I was right before. I can't try to get into a relationship until I'm where I want to be in life, not working a retail job instead of what I want to be doing. Or at least until I'm making moves to get that career, networking and making connections instead of just applying online for video editing jobs like I've been.

 Not to say that I should only get a video editing job to be able to get into a relationship. I'm passionate about video editing and do want to do it as a career, especially because I have to start paying my student loans off soon and I want to be putting my college degree to use by then so I can say I actually got something out of college and not be paying back thousands of dollars in debt with nothing to show for it.",Just Venting 😮‍💨,28,17,2025-04-02 20:06:32
dating,Put the “active” in active listening.,"Put the “active” in active listening.

I recently had a conversation with a guy where I told him that when I would tell him stories about my life I felt that there was little to no response or that all he said was “ok”. Or he immediately moved on to a related story about his life. He told me that this was because he was trying to process what I was saying but was also afraid of asking stupid questions in response. While this is understandable, that didn’t excuse the complete lack of response I was getting. As someone who has worked in the mental health setting and taken counseling classes during grad school for social work, I wanted to share some tips I’ve learned on active listening that I use both in my career and in my dating life.

1. Ask connecting questions- if you ask someone what they do for work and they tell you, follow up with questions like “what drew you to that?”, “do you enjoy what you do?”, “do you have any crazy work stories?”. Look for little highlights in their responses and use these to formulate follow up questions. Also, it’s better to ask stupid questions than no questions.

2. Avoid immediately jumping into a related story- as someone with ADHD, I can be tempted to immediately jump into telling a story that relates to theirs because that’s how I show them how I relate to them. However, this can make the other party feel disregarded, especially if their story or opinion involved a degree of vulnerability. Respond to their story first before telling yours.

3. Paraphrase what they just said- reflect back what they said to you to show your engagement. You don’t have to do this with every sentence, but if someone is being vulnerable this can help them feel that you were actively listening.

4. Remember details and circle back to them in the conversation- things like “oh, is this the same friend you mentioned earlier?”, or “you mentioned this park, where else do you like to hike?”. This shows that you remember details of the conversation.

5. Show your engagement both verbally and nonverbally- keep your posture towards them, maintain comfortable eye contact, and use phrases like “uh-huh”, “yeah” or “I see”. This portrays interest to the other person. 

I hope these are marginally helpful, just remember to lead your conversations with curiosity and there’s no real formula to a perfect conversation. If you use these strategies, also pay attention to whether or not the other person is using them too! Both parties deserve to feel like the other person is interested in them.

dating,"Man, cheater defenders are an entirely different breed","I've heard so many excuses to justify cheating from a certain person.

Some time ago, they thought a relationship shouldn't end due to a mistake, and breaking up over a single instance is wrong and the person who got cheated on is overreacting.

Recently, this same person was like ""Well, it was clearly the fault of the person who was cheated on"" when referring to a whole ass affair. Their logic is that if their partner was happy, they would have never cheated, and the person who was cheated on didn't do enough.

dating,"I’m heartbroken, but I did it to myself","To make a long story short I let myself build an attachment to this girl I work with and now I’m suffering the consequences for it mentally. For those that give a shit here’s the context.

I’ve liked this girl since Fall last year, around the time she joined our team. I thought she was cute but I didn’t start really liking her the way I do now until I slowly got to know her more and started hanging outside of work with her. We’d hang for hrs on end, like 6-7 hrs on end even right after work, just walking around drinking tall-boys and just talking. It was all platonic but I really dug her vibe, with every hangout I started liking her more and more. Then things got less platonic.

One night we hit up a bar after work and she gets really flirty with me towards the end, she started wrapping her arms around mine and resting her head on my shoulder. Long story short we ended up making out that night for idk how long. When we got to talking about it she stated she started developing a crush on me, BUT stated she just wanted to be friends (since apparently she was talking to a girl at the time). Sucked but I respected it.

The second time this happens I run into her at a bar, she’s there with her friends and I’m there with mine. We say our hellos then get back to vibing with our friends, then towards the end she comes and finds me so we can take shots together. Me and her left the bar and end up at my apartment, just when I thought I’d gotten over her by that point we’re laid up in my bed watching a movie. We start making out again and right before we’re about to progress she stops it and says once again that we should stay friends. She kept reiterating how much she liked me but couldn’t get too involved with coworkers (her last workplace relationship at our job was a toxic man that cheated on her with a minor apparently). Once again I understood but the shit definitely sucked because it felt like right when I was about to move on from her that night out just resurfaced feelings… only to end up in the same results.

This is all really on me though for allowing myself to 1. Build an attachment early and 2. Not setting a boundary myself so that I could move on quicker, since she’s a coworker it’s hard avoiding them as it is but I felt I could’ve played my part to not let myself devoid so much of my emotions, mental health and heartstrings on this. I’ve liked other girls at my job but my feelings for them never got this deep. 

The reason I’m heartbroken though is now I’m suspecting her and another girl (another coworker) might be having a thing. I’m not 100% but I have a feeling. Not that it’s any of my business anyways because we aren’t/were never together, but being turned down for one alleged reason then seeing the same person “going against that” with someone else stings. Again, I did this shit to myself but it still hurts.

I have no reason to hold any attachment to this girl, but even acknowledging that I’ve allowed my brain to like her for so long that this process of moving on feels brutal as all hell. And yeah I get it, “don’t shit where you eat”, I’m just now seeing the repercussions. It’s crazy that I’m even feeling this way about a girl I never dated, yet the pain feels akin to a breakup, I’m amazed how much I let myself let this girl effect my mental health this much. Today in particular I wanted to crawl into a hole and die. I’ll move on eventually but this shit sucks.",Just Venting 😮‍💨,6,5,2025-04-03 02:25:59

dating,My experience so far with speed  dating.,"I have been to two speed dating events so far since being single. There are not a lot of dating events in my town, nor are there singles events. 

I went to one this last Saturday. There were three women I was really interested in. Of them none matched with me. There were twenty three women and twenty three men. The rounds were three minutes long. 

This last Saturday I was nervous before our intermission. I had had a very long day at work but decided to go anyways. They needed more men. After the intermission I was very energetic with the first three women. One woman I thought we connected well through our love of Harry Potter. 

This last Saturday I also noticed that the majority of the women came with at least one other friend. It varied for the men. Some men came with friends and some didn’t. 

This last Saturday I didn’t get any matches at all. I talked to two other guys and they got at least three matches but weren’t feeling those matches. After the event was over I tried to talk to two of the women that I thought were pretty cool. They both brushed me off after I asked if I can sit with them, both citing that they were hanging out with friends. I left feeling defeated, however I feel differently now. It is what it is.

The first time I went was a blast. I connected very well with a woman. She ended up matching with me and we planned a date but she ended up canceling. After the event was over though I ended up talking to some people which was better. 

My experience so far has been that even if I have a lot of energy, even if I get a lot of laughs there is no guarantee that you will match with anybody. I always show up authentically but just a more upbeat and energetic version of myself. However, by the end of the event I am usually pretty tired. It takes a lot out of me, especially if the room is warm.

Well, that’s been my experience so far. Just wanted to share. If you have any comments on speed dating please leave some. ",Support Needed 🫂,47,38,2025-04-02 13:53:36

But I’m finding that it seems like when guys say they want to take things slow, what they really mean is they want to be super casual, noncommittal, and nonchalant for an indefinite period of time.

dating,Dead inside these days,"For the last seven years since my divorce I (40f) have felt better being alone by far than being in a bad or unfulfilling relationship. I’ve been in two relationships since then (one brief that ended when he moved out of state and one a little longer with a man who turned out to be physically and emotionally abusive), but have been single for almost four years now. I’ve done a lot of work on myself in the past few years, and have a lot going for me. However the fact that I have so much love to give and nobody seems to want it is getting very discouraging. It’s making me doubt every facet of my life. 

I know I am worthy of love and romance and emotional support but it feels each day like there’s just nobody out there for me and the endless void of feeling dead inside is evolving into a pit of sadness. I’m not desperate to be in a relationship or anything but why is it so hard to develop even the most surface level of connections with people these days? I have never felt so disposable or unwanted in my entire life despite feeling more confident in my body, job, etc than I have in years. I don’t know if this is just the result of the 40+ dating pool, if this is related to living currently in Las Vegas (a very weird city for dating), or if I just am truly a person that nobody wants to spend any meaningful time with because I have personality defects that I am unaware of. But the constant micro heartbreaks are doing a number on me. 

I don’t know, I have gone from feeling alone but mostly content, to feeling more and more lonely lately and I don’t like the feeling. I’ve lived here a little over a year and in that time have also struggled to make platonic friendships though I suspect that’s also common in the 40+ crowd. 

I don’t think advice is really what’s needed; I just need to know that even if I’m alone physically I’m not alone in feeling this way. ",Support Needed 🫂,68,33,2025-04-02 11:08:15

dating,When I've starting to learn about the existance of 'limerence',"Not sure which tag I would be using here, I guess I discovered something and wanted to share and also wanted to vent a bit and ask for support.

I've turned my life around after being my lesserself for some time, hitting the gym find some more time for hobbies and starting heading outside more, interacting with people, opening up and starting conversations, some might even call it casual flirting with some. I definitely got more attention overal from women, like they feel I'm more ""attractive"" or approachable in some way.

It came with a downside as well, developing a crush on a coworker which I interacted with before but somehow I fet attracted to her more and more. Unwanted because I want to focus on work at work and build out my personal life and keep both separated.

I definitely felt we got attraction and first thought it was friendly but later I felt it getting more than just friendly, at least from my side. I noticed she also kept asking more personal questions, which I answered high level not to going tofar over my boundaries.

I went looking on internet what was going on and how I could deal with this, if it was really a crush or my mind tricking me into something that's not there, because I don't want it to develop because of risk for my job.

While searching I found 'limerence' and looked deeper into this. I found below stages from an article and I seem to be heading into stage 3, reality.

I found myself distancing from the person and trying to avoid interaction to not feel awkward around her and focus on work, because I don't want to feel this way but still be respectful to the person in question.

I guess it all have to happen when I started opening more up to people and be more talkative and I end with myself getting hurt being obsessed by someone I know I cannot be with.

Coming back on the first sentence, I guess I just wanted to vent a bit, getting stuff out of my mind and wondering if what I'm going through is normal. I would appriciate any support.

Article:

Stage 1) Infatuation: much like how we would with a crush, this stage is where we become increasingly curious about our person. We tend to think about them a lot, trivial or not: how do they like their coffee in the morning? do they even like coffee?

Stage 2) Crystallization: this is where we begin our journey out of “crush” and into the tell-tale sign of limerence. At this stage, our person could not be any more than perfect in our eyes, it’s the proverbial “rose-colored glasses” to the equally well-known “love is blind”. You feel that this person is your soulmate. You’re now teetering between cute curiosity and all-consuming love. However, as you ride these blissful feelings off into the quickly setting sun, the fear of rejection rears its ugly head. What if your person doesn’t feel the same way? those “rose-colored glasses” begin to shatter. Leading us to stage…

3) Deterioration aka the reality. This is where you hit rock bottom and realize, and ultimately accept, that the intense feelings you have for your person are unrequited. There is now an immense sense of loss.",Support Needed 🫂,6,4,2025-04-02 21:41:45
dating,Is this considered cheating?,"I (24F) have been dating this guy (27M) for a while now. He has always dated me exclusively, but I was dating around when I met him. At some point I brought up exclusivity and what I understood is that he is interested in exclusivity and nothing else, but also I said that I had been talking to other people and that I'll stop that gradually. 

It was very hard for me to stop talking to everyone because I didn't want to just ghost them but I am very non confrontational. So couple of months later I got tired of blowing them off and of uninteresting conversations ands sent everyone a message that I was no longer interested in dating and that I am going to try with one guy. Some were fine with that and we sort of stayed friends. Most I hadn't even gone out on a date with and even if I did it was just friendly and nothing happened. 

Before sending this message, I met one guy that I had been talking with, purely out of sheer pressure and running out of excuses. I had already been on a very uncomfortable date with him but then we were on friendly terms. He is also the type to sleep around and ask me about his girl problems. I met him a second time and he was hinting that he wanted to sleep with me (as in a friend's with benefits situation) and I had told him I would probably not be in the mood at all and that I would like to just meet with him in a friendly way with no expectations. I was find with that, but then during the meet up I felt very very pressured by him because he couldn't even return home (last train was gone) so he had to stay at my place. Ultimately we hooked up, and honestly I was very detached the whole time and did not enjoy it at all. It's the first time I ever hooked up. I think it hit me so hard that I was able to be pressured like that that not long after is when I sent the message to everyone that I wanted to be JUST friends 100% and that I was going exclusive with someone. 

The guy I am dating exclusively now doesn't know any of that, and I wonder if he thought we were exclusive back then, and if he did whether this is something I should disclose as it kind of traumatized me a little bit, but I think it's fair. Also I wouldn't want him to think I cheated on him, because back then I was not aware whether he thought we were exclusive or not at all, so I am a little scared to tell him because of that. I also would like a little mental support over it. 
The guy I hooked up with knows nothing of this, he thinks I enjoyed it then went exclusive then that's it. And we are still friends technically, only I know how I felt then and I don't know how to handle it.

dating,I let societal norms and toxic people in my life gaslight me out of my valid feelings and desires (21M),"So ever since around 17 I’ve wanted to date but I was at that time pretty behind socially due to growing up with Asperger’s. Everyone kind of put me in the awkward kid category and that didn’t really change in college either. I joined a fraternity, went to a few parties and tried my best to talk to girls. I didn’t do anything inappropriate but I wasn’t really good at it. My fraternity ended up balling me because they didn’t want me reflecting bad on them, which is kind of wild since the whole point of fraternities is to help people out. Last year I kind of cut everyone off because Overall I just felt like no one in my life was willing to acknowledge my wants and needs. Honestly the people in my life who did this to me hurt me way more than being lonely ever did. 

Like just because I was going through shit when other people my age were having fun doesn’t mean that I missed the boat. If I want to go to parties and talk to girls at 22 I’ll damn well do whatever i want. Same thing with my sex life. No one has the right to tell me who I can and can’t flirt with and it makes me so angry that people feel like they can. Like it feels like I’m being emotionally violated. 

Nobody invalidates women by telling them they aren’t capable or cute enough to have a sex life and should just be kind and stick to having a few friends, yet so many people I talk to put me into a separate category just because I’m not what people would call a “bad boy”. Well if that’s what you think then you may as well be invisible to me. I’m not some “kind beautiful soul” who is better off “waiting”. I’ll do whatever the hell I want. I’ve spent my entire life seeing people enjoy relationships, feeling lonely, and being told that I’m just not that guy. I’m whoever the hell I want to be and it disgusts me that anyone would ever think they have the right to dismiss or reduce me. 


I never had the courage to stand up for my feelings until recently. I ended up basically cutting off everyone I knew except for my family and starting again from scratch. New friends, new job, new canvas. I don’t really regret this because I’m able to choose who can know me and what my social life is going forward. From now on who I am, my past, present and future, aren’t up to what others know, rather what I tell them.

He is actively working on it with his therapist.  

I shared this piece with him, and he was very touched. He encouraged me to share it, saying that even if it brings just a tiny bit of self-awareness to someone, it’s worth it.

If this speaks to you as well, hopefully at some point, with a lot of reflection, help and support, you can step out of that fear.


“You were used to viewing the world from a place of deficit, and as a result, joy felt foreign to you. If you're used to feeling abandoned, if you already know what it's like for people to disappoint or reject you —well, it may not feel good, but at least there are no surprises; you know the customs in your own homeland. Once you step into foreign territory, though —if you spend time with reliable people who find you appealing and interesting — you might feel anxious and disoriented. All of a sudden, nothing's familiar. You have no landmarks, nothing to go by, and all of the predictability of the world you're used to is gone. The place you came from may not be great — it might, in fact, be pretty awful — but you knew exactly what you'd get there (disappointment, chaos, isolation, criticism).


There's a term for this irrational fear of joy: cherophobia (chero is the Greek word for ""re-joice""). People with cherophobia are like Teflon pans in terms of pleasure
— it doesn't stick (though pain cakes on them as if to an ungreased surface). I's common for people with traumatic histories to expect disaster just around the corner. Instead of leaning into the goodness that comes their way, they become hypervigilant, always waiting for something to go wrong. 
Joy isn’t pleasure. It’s anticipatory pain.”

Felt it was necessary to give this context so yall know I’m not COMPLETELY elementary with this stuff.

Anyways… I just went on my first date with this girl and everything seemed to be going great! We were there chatting for hours, I walked her back to the car gave her a hug, she said she didn’t ever want to let go of me, finally she let go and as i started walking away she brought me back in for a few kisses. I was really happy. This was my first time putting myself out there and it seemed to be great. We were texting on Instagram beforehand but after we parted ways, she sent me her number. I followed up basically saying how much I enjoyed our time together and I look forward to seeing her again…

No response

Next day I posted a pic on my story of some dish that I cooked and she responded to it with “damn now I’m hungry” and we had a literal 4 message banter. She hearted the last message with no response after that.

At the end of the day, i asked her how her day was. No response to that either and that’s where things are now. She watches all my stories now but never responded to where we left things and it’s really getting to me. I don’t want to text her again and come off desperate but I’m just so confused.

dating,How does waiting to sleep w someone work?,"Hi. So I know this may come across like a silly question but I'm asking to hear your experiences w this- on either side of asking of being asked to wait, and both in situations where people were and weren't okay with it💕

So me 31 nb am used to (usually) sleeping w people on the first date. I enjoy sex, it's important (to me) to learn if that chemistry is there early on bc that is a dealbreaker for me if the vibe isn't right.

And where we're at now, it's been a while since I've been out w anyone, been on an intentional dating break and I've figured out a lot abt myself and how I've changed over the years and recently too. And I'd like to at least give waiting a try and I'm just like....not sure how to picture what that would be like or how to do that besides the obvious not making a move and saying ""I wanna wait a lil"" when they try to start something? 

But like how long is ""reasonable?"" (Any amount of time someone wants to wait is valid. Just like how much time do/are you/people in general comfortable w waiting)

dating,Starting to find different types attractive,"I've (33m) been single for a long time, about 17 years. Has the fact I've been single for so long influenced my change in type of women I am attracted to?

There's women in my town and workplace that five or ten years ago I wouldn't have even thought of approaching or find attractive but all of a sudden I'm finding I'm attracted to them.

Is it because I'm getting desperate (hate to say it like that) that I'm willing to give it a go with someone less attractive? Don't get me wrong, I'm no oil painting. Or am I finally growing up and seeing them for who they are, their personality and that's what I'm attracted to?

dating,guy that im dating feels that sending nudes is demeaning for him,"so a few weeks ago i (24f) was talking to the guy (24m) im dating and i cant even remember how this conversation started but he ended up telling me that he doesn’t send nudes because he feels like its demeaning.

i was taken aback by this because just a week prior, he’d asked that if i was comfy would i be okay sending spicy pics. now this is something i actively enjoy, like a lot, so i was glad he asked and sent him some literally that day. 

so during the conversation i asked him outright if he felt like it was demeaning that i sent those pictures to him and he told me no, not at all, it’s just a preference he has for himself.

and that is PERFECTLY! okay! okay? like i truly wouldn’t care if the man never sent me a single nude in his life, but the word “demeaning” feels awfully strong and truly makes me feel like there’s some notion in his mind about everyone who sends them, not just him.

also, him being okay with asking me for something he personally views as demeaning for himself is beyond me.

i told him as much, and he told me that if i ever asked he’d be okay sending them to me as he’s done with his ex, but most of the women who have asked him have been randos on dating apps and he feels like it would be wrong to send it to them. also another totally valid point!! but it’s not what he was saying before, his statement before was very general and it felt like he was backtracking due to my reaction so it didn’t feel genuine. 

it’s confusing to me too because he’s incredibly sex positive and open to many, many things, so that line of thought was surprising. also he literally said he’d make a sextape?? so im like how are nudes where you draw the line! 

im thinking about this now though because he’s currently away for the week and while im a spontaneous spicy pic sender, this is the kind of time where i’d 100% be sending something. i even took the pics, but i can’t shake the conversation and its making me second guess sending anything.

idk, am i being dramatic or? ",I Need Advice 😩,0,40,2025-04-02 22:35:52
dating,Why some men pull back.,"Especially in the initial stages. It could be that he enjoyed only the thrill of the chase. However, I want to focus on another reason; one that is not highlighted often. At times men such as I (24 m) will lose interest when the women we are dating is passive and puts in low effort. These are women that will agree to go on dates. However, while I please her, ask deep questions and actively listen to them, I barely get anything back. I initiate all conversations, text, calls, flirting, meeting in person among others. I don't feel that zealous energy from them. In the past, I thought they were either shy or cautious therefore, I had to put in more effort and lead. Only to get the dissapointing ""I don't feel the spark"" conversation from them in the end. At a point, this became a real chore. Now when I sense a woman is extremely passive like providing low effort texts, does not initiate any conversation or dates as I do, does not match my energy when we meet up: I take those as signs of disinterest and move on. I want to tell my fellow sisters here that showing some reciprocation back can really progress the relationship. You don't necessarily have to lead but initiating texting, calls, flirting and dates can make a difference. If I sense a woman is crazy into me as I am into them, it makes me fall for them even harder. ",Giving Advice 💌,639,261,2025-04-01 09:37:39

dating,"Not sure if it is a date, should I ask her or just go with the flow?","I (M18) have known this girl (F18) for a while now and we went out together a couple of times (twice). She's from the same school and goes to the same gym as me, so we see eachother at least once every two days.

I texted her right after i met her and asked her out to get coffee, and she agreed. It went great and we spent like 4 hours together just chatting, visiting some shops, getting food etc. It went really well.

Then she was busy with school and work so we went out again after a month or so. Again, it went great. I really liked her vibe and at one point she even asked me if I like her, to which i obviously said yes. Then she asked me if it was a date to which I said ""I don't know, do you think this is a date?"" and she said ""I don't know!"" with a smile on her face. So i naturally told her that next time, it will be a date to which she just replied ""I don't have to wear high heels, right?"" in a good way. It all kind of ended there and we switched to a different topic.

That was about a month ago and we're supposed to go out again this Friday and she seems keen on going. I'm not sure if it is a date though - I want to bring her a single rose and I don't want to rush things or make her feel uncomfortable, so that's why I'm asking you guys. What do you think?

But when I say that I prefer texting or voice noting they shame me or question and judge me for it like I'm weird or crazy and dismiss my feelings and reasons for it completely.

dating,Guy I’m dating said I have an attitude,"We (22F and 22M) had just had our fourth date (dinner and drinks). It was nice and ended at his place. We had messed around a lil and after, we laid down just chilling. I had said something playfully (I dead can’t remember what) and he pretended to slap my face in turn. I honestly didn’t like it but brushed it off bc of whatever I had said right before that. I was like okay tbh the play pretend slap is fair.  

Then later when we were cuddling he pretended to punch at my side. This time there wasn’t any convo or joking prior to that. That’s when I got up from laying down and told him straight up that I do not like the playfighting/pretending to hit me at all and that he’s not my little brother or something. He seemed to understand and stopped. But then shortly after said he didn’t like my tone when I said it 😅 

I started explaining that I wasn’t trying to have any kind of tone, just being firm in my boundaries and I started talking about how for me, stuff like that always seems like the start before someone actually starts following through and physically harming you. I also explained just to cover all grounds that when we’re intimate, I don’t mind him slapping certain areas or being aggressive but my face is not one of them I ever want to try. He said he understood what I was saying but that I could’ve said it in a less mean way. Then started talking about how he’s scared I’m going to be mean to him now? I started explaining how me being firm in my tone when I talk about dislikes isn’t being mean and he said I had an attitude. And every time I said no I don’t have an attitude he’d be like see you literally do right now. 

I had mentioned to him a few days before this how I’ve def caught an attitude at work (specifically when I’m told what to do) and recognize it’s a problem in myself. After I denied having an attitude during this moment, he said “oh you don’t have an attitude and that’s why you always get one at work when they ask you to do basic tasks, right?” I was fr getting pissed at this point and started getting my uber. He asked if I was mad at him and then started laying his head on me trying to cuddle again. I honestly got the ick when he was doing this and just wanted to go. I don’t want to dismiss his feelings but I did genuinely feel like he was too sensitive. I didn’t raise my voice or act crazy, just very straightforward and direct. 

I couldn’t tell if he really believed I was “being mean” and catching an attitude with him or if he was using it as a way to make sure I don’t call him out for anything that makes me uncomfortable again. I’ve taken some days to reflect and thought well maybe I wasn’t as self-aware as I thought and I really was sounding hostile unintentionally or something. But considering I’m aware of it when I’m at work, I think I’d know if I was fr “being mean” while at his place. It just felt like he cared more about my tone and less about the fact I don’t want him play hitting me. 

After I got my uber though he walked me down and made sure I got in safe and texted him. We’ve still been talking everyday like we have been and I have moved on from it for now but just need advice from other perspectives! I usually block at the first feeling something might be an issue but he has been really great in all other areas and so far it’s been the healthiest connection I’ve felt. That being said, we’ve only been talking since mid February. This is honestly the first red flag/weird feeling I’ve gotten so idk if it was a genuine miscommunication or on purpose. I do think if it becomes a reoccurring thing where he resorts to that whenever I set boundaries then it would be 100% a no.

dating,Disappointed,"(29F) Let me preface by saying that I’m in an awkward “figuring it out” phase, wanting a relationship but unsure if I’m ready for one. 

I have a 3rd date tonight. We met at a casual bar and ended up hooking up on the first night which I’m fine with. The second “date” was just ordering in and Netflix & chilling at his place because he was coming home late from a trip and that was the only night we could see each other, which was fine given the circumstances. 

During this date we discussed intentions/what we’re looking for and it sounds like we’re on the same page of wanting a relationship but taking our time, not rushing, and just seeing if there’s compatibility between us. 

After that night, I asked if he’d want to do a real date next time and he said yes. I was kind of waiting all week for him to reach out plan it, but he just sent me a link yesterday to this casual tapas wine bar. I actually can’t drink this week because of a medication I’m on, and told him this, but I guess we’re still going here.

I’m by no means materialistic and don’t need someone to take me out on fancy/fun dates all the time, but I feel like it’s kind of weird that we’ve had two pretty casual dates, and that he wouldn’t want to plan either a nicer restaurant date or an activity given that I can’t drink. I just feel like when dating, the dates have variety to get a good idea of how the other person interacts in different environments.

dating,People need to stop acting like being single is a bad thing and something is wrong with them.,"Being single doesn’t mean you’re ugly or not good enough—it just means the right person hasn’t come along yet. And honestly? That’s totally fine.

Too many people these days think that if you're single, something must be wrong with you. That’s complete nonsense. Don’t fall for that trap. Being in a relationship doesn’t define your worth, and you definitely don’t need to rush into something just because society makes you feel like you should.

The truth is, being single is actually a great time to focus on yourself, do what makes you happy, and build a life you love.

dating,Feeling demoralized,"27M. At this point, been a little over a year on all the main apps, and I’ve only met with two women. Most recent one I thought I was so lucky. I thought I actually found something. She was just my type, had a fun personality and style. She was actually into me, which I’d never experienced before. 

But last couple of weeks she just got more and more distant. Today at lunch I see she’s blocked me on everything. We went from texting all day, good mornings and good nights, pictures back and forth all day, to blocked in just a couple weeks. 

I would’ve preferred a text calling things off. I know I have no right to that, but the block just hurts. This was the first woman I had really felt a connection with, ever. That I was really excited about. I’d never had good luck dating even back in college.

I just don’t know what the fuck to do. I feel like crying but barely anything comes out. I live in one of the worst places for singles, and that’s not even counting my preferences vs common preferences here. The dating apps are hell. I know you all know that part.

I don’t even know why I’m posting. I just need to get it off my chest. Irl, to everyone I know, I’m the ever unbothered, always supportive guy. I distracted myself earlier with working out, and I thought I was fine, but now I’m sitting alone in my apartment typing this out and no, I’m not fine.

If a person lacks empathy, it signifies a low emotional intelligence and no regard for humanity and/or animals. An obvious red flag. 

2. Impulsive and rash behavior. I think this one is pretty simple to understand.

dating,I think he’s just shy - opinions?,"OK so I’ve been DMing with someone for 2 weeks, (both 17, I’m f) I added him and he messaged me first about a post I made. I was really kinda surprised he said anything but I went with it. We talked a bit online but it went dry after a couple days because neither of us was being flirty. He’s in one of my classes but we didn’t talk in person, there’s always friends around. 

So anyway after it went dry I finally just said it, that I’m dry in text with ppl I don’t know — and I asked him to hang out after spring break (we both went away - me to a foreign country with a class and him with his friends somewhere.) He said yes to hanging out immediately, and we texted a lot that night. I even referred to our mutual friend being a “bad wingman” and he agreed, so I mean there was no real question as to the intention. 

We finally talked in school the next day. It seemed fine to me but he acted really nervous, like nervous continuous chatter until he said he had to “go pee” and went off to the bathroom lol… Anyway after that day was break and he only texted a little as replies to me and I was busy too, so I didn’t make a big effort, and finally he left me unread. He was hardly online at all in that week but he looked at all my stories (didn’t like them) but liked some meme about not being able to talk to girls and how he’d be alone forever. He’s definitely nerdy and awkward but I think that’s cute. 

Now back in school and he didn’t make eye contact before class, stayed back in the room when I left. I was too shy to wait for him or walk over so I left. 

Do I text him one more time to see if he’s just being awkward and ask if he’s still down to hang out? Or leave it? Or do I just say “hey what’s up” to see if he responds?  Part of me thinks if I just say hey, it puts pressure on him to *do* something. If I ask him if he’s still down, it’s more forward but at least takes the pressure of him besides saying yes or no. 

We have one or two mutual friends and my one guy friend thinks he’s being an ass - but again, he isn’t a good wingman so I don’t think he’s gonna talk to him unless I ask. 

I’m not too invested in this and I don’t even care that he didn’t text during a break since I hardly know him. I guess I just hate games and prefer closure if this isn’t his thing. Plus 3 months of avoiding eye contact but not knowing why, is weird lol. I want to text him today because I won’t even be in school tomorrow.

dating,What do I do with this girl,"So I 26(m) matched with this girl 22(F) she does live in a different state and we been talking for a week, bantering, flirting day and night and I thought it was going good . We talked about calling, family, hobbies( getting to know you stuff) and she seemed interested because she always asked questions, flirted and she would respond within less than 5 minutes .

This is how our last convo went
Her: I just want chicken nuggets
Me: Will you share them with me?
Her: if you buy
Me: Ill give you half a chicken nuggets and a ketchup pack ( I was trying to be funny)
Her: I won’t share then😭
Me: How about a full nugget, a toy and you watch any show you want with me on call
Her: Im more of a food girl but I’ll pass
Me: I respect that enjoy your food
Her: haha thank you

And then that was the end of that convo, I was taken a back when she said that and I thought she would say yes considering how she kept flirting and suggesting a day before we should have our date on facetime and watch a TV show I love.

I did message her the next morning(yesterday )to reassure im still good and interested and to txt whenever she misses me and to focus on her stuff today. I know I did say all of that and I meant it BUT I did post on my instagram story and she viewed it and my message to her has been left on delivered for more about 12 hrs and usually she responds super quick.

dating,I hate it when coworkers always talk about dating,"I (23 M) have not been in a relationship. I've been on some dates, but they haven't led to anything. I used to be on dating apps, but I stopped using them for now after not having much luck on them. 

At one of my past jobs, I was usually one of the only single people on my team. Most others were in a relationship. Besides the tasks we were doing at work, it felt like they were always talking about their relationships, like the dates they were going on or their wedding plans. I felt awkward, upset, and lonely when they would talk about this. I had nothing to contribute and I would just go home feeling bad about myself. I no longer work at that job (I left for other reasons lol), but that was still the thing I hated the most about that place.

I'm probably coming across as bitter, but when you it's people you have to be with (unless you just quit your job), it was annoying. I think I did say something to a coworker once about wanting a relationship, and it was a cliche response like ""relationships come when you least expect them"" or ""enjoy being single"".

Guy: that's cool

Guy, a few days later: hey where did you go?

Guy: Hi. What are your hobbies?

Guy: oh that sounds cool. Do you like to travel?

Me: \[writes 3-4 sentences about my thoughts\] Do you have any exciting travel plans this year?

Guy: yeah. So you live in \[town\]?

*Note at this point, the guy is asking questions but I'm getting nothing back. Many of the questions are pretty much ignored, others are answered as if we were in a contentious deposition*

Me: Yes, do you also live nearby?

Guy: yeah we should hang out sometime when we are both free.

*okay....lol unclear what I'm supposed to do with this? Am I supposed to just say ""yeah""?*

These conversations both feel to me like talking to a teenager that's mad at me because I didn't let them go to a concert with their friends lol. Am I weird for thinking this is not the way conversations should happen? This has been a weird recurring thing....

dating,What makes a man feel “emasculated” by a woman?,"Not that I particularly care, but I am curious, from the mouths of men themselves … 

Is it intelligence, or the way it is used? 

Is it how women engage in conversation? Is it being “direct” and “assertive” in their speech?

Is it in not being trusting of a man? What makes men feel this way? Please use specific examples. This is the only thing I think that qualifies on this list as being an actual challenge to intimacy, but it’s not “emasculating”.

dating,Was it weird for her to send a selfie?,"Met a woman on Facebook Dating, the most random and worst dating app there is.  She barely ever responded over a couple of months so I said eff it and gave her my number.

She was hesitant to go on a date and avoided the question a few times. Then finally admitted that she doesn’t know any English and was afraid i would be bored with her.

Well, I told her the date would still be fun and we can communicate using google translate.  She agreed.

We met last night after 4 months of being matched haha.

I surprised her by speaking Spanish. Not much and not great, but enough to hold conversations. I’m a red head southern guy so she definitely wasn’t expecting it.  I’ve just always had an interesting in learning a new language so I took to Spanish quite well.

Anyways, date was really awesome. She is super pretty, way prettier than her pictures. I’m definitely interested and thought we had a fun connection.


We talk again today and she asks if we can go out again this week or weekend so we set up another date.  We are chatting for awhile via text and she sends a random selfie.  I compliment it (never had a woman send a random selfie)


Later she jokes “it’s not fair if you don’t send one back!”



I thought it was weird. Is this weird or just a thing that people do when they like each other?

We are both 35 so maybe I’m old and not getting how all this works but I haven’t sent one back yet. Idk what to do lol.

I like her and definitely am going to go on dates with her. Just didn’t know what to make of the selfie ordeal.

I was hanging out with this girl, and after I saw her do coke in front of me, I lost a lot of respect for her.  I just couldn't look at her the same way.

My friend told me that she called out her ex-BF for lying about doing coke in the bathroom at a party.  A few friends of mine recently pulled out a bag of white powder and all started taking bumps at my friend's BF's apartment. I was offered some, and declined. I later found out that it was ketamine, and one of the people there was telling me how much he wanted to be the first one to give it to me. It was honestly kind of awkward.

dating,I'm confused on what I'm doing wrong (26M),"

So this may be a bit convoluted but here's the backstory of the current problem 

So basically I've been off and on trying to find a relationship for a while because I feel like it's what I'm missing in my life but it feels like everytime I start to feel something for anyone it always ends with me only being seen as a friend or even the friendship side falling apart all together so I largely have a hard time really trying to get close to people because I feel like it will always end the same way because nothing changes and it really does drain on me.

So recently it was kinda a similar case as before but I started thinking maybe there was something there so I decided to force myself to be more confident and open thinking that maybe confidence would change my luck a bit and I thought maybe for once there was at least something mutual but now the person in question is dating someone else and it just once again became a case of only being seen as a friend 

I don't know what I keep doing wrong and I thought making a few changes would help but now I'm at a point where I'm 26 and have never been on a date and I feel like the lack of experience will make it impossible for me to get a date but I can't get the experience because nobody ever sees anything in me 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong and I'm just at a lost at this point and I know a few people have tried to help me and talk to me recently about not giving up but idk if not giving up will do me any good if I don't know what I've done wrong in the first place 😭

I just want things to be different because being alone especially at this point in life is extremely difficult and I don't want that isolated life anymore ",I Need Advice 😩,6,7,2025-04-01 03:40:37
dating,Super attached after 4 days,"Hello, i met a guy online and we really have a good vibe. We have only been in contact for 4 days but I am already feeling butterflies when I talk to him. We talk on the phone alot and he is a dream man in my eyes. Opticwise and also personality wise. We met up today and I could not help myself and in a moment where he was away, I looked through his Tinder and saw that he had 200+ open chats, more than 300 matches and about 800 unmatched matches waiting to be matched (he has Tinder +) 
I don't know it somehow made me very unsure because I thought that I am the only girl he talks too. I am however already super attached and if he would ask me to be his girl i would say yes. His Tinder activities however give me the vibes, that I am just one of many girls. The sex with him was so passionate, I can't imagine that he did not feel the same way I did/do.

dating,"Am I making this introverted guy comfortable, or am I boring?","I (28/F) got out of a relationship in November because my ex (28/M) constantly needed entertained. I'm an American living in the UK and very extroverted, so I'm used to constant small talk, asking lots of questions, keeping the conversation going, etc.

However, my ex took advantage of that. I was expected be ""on"" all the time. The second I wasn't interesting/wanted to relax he would turn to his phone, complain that he wasn't having fun, and tease whatever I suggested we do (since most of the date planning/paying was on me). Turns out he had a p\*rn and gambling addiction, too.

After months of therapy and self-reflection, I met a new guy (34/M) on a dating app. I quickly realized how nervous he was. Didn't talk much, fidgeted a lot, struggled to make eye contact. Told me upfront that he's an introvert. But exhausted with constantly entertaining men, I just... let there be silence sometimes. I asked him questions, but if there was a lull in the convo I just politely smiled, and eventually we'd find something else to talk about.

On our fourth date we walked through a park, and at one point had 30+ minutes of silence. We sat under a tree and he fell asleep on my shoulder. When he woke up he told me he can't remember a time he's been so relaxed. Later we grabbed a drink at the pub, and once again he just stared at me smiling. I asked why and he said, ""I'm just smitten.""

I'm struggling to relax my nervous system around him even though I feel completely comfortable. It's so nice not to have to talk 24/7. For someone to simply enjoy my company. But I'm fighting the fear that he'll get bored of me.

dating,Is it wrong to hope for a caring vibe even in online conversations?,"I’ve been talking to a guy online for a few months now. Our conversations are smooth, and he’s patient, but I don’t feel a genuine caring vibe from him. He’s mentioned future plans like going on trips or doing activities to get to know each other better when we meet, which sounds nice, but it feels like more of an idea than something emotionally meaningful.

We live in different states, so meeting in person isn’t possible yet, but I’m hoping there will be more emotional warmth and care when we actually meet, beyond just these casual plans. Is it wrong to expect that emotional connection to develop through these discussions, or is it too early to expect that level of care?

dating,I’m over thinking when/how I should text her next.,"So this weekend was kinda wild in the most best of ways. There’s a longer story here but to save your eyes holes and my fingers time, I’ll give the short version. This gorgeous girl who I’ve crushed on from a distance for a LONG time and I hooked up twice this weekend. I didn’t even know I existed on her radar. Turns out she had been eye balling me this whole time, and that night was the night we both had “fuck it” moments and made our moves. 

We danced at a club on Friday night and she came home after and did adult activities. She stayed the night, we woke up and did more adult activities, drank coffee for a good while and had a really good conversation (like, really good). Then I took her back to get her car. I tried holding off on texting her bc I didn’t want to seem over eager and clingy (I’ve been known to do that). But she left an earring so I texted her about it, and again one thing led to another and Sunday night she came back over. We talked more (this girl is a good conversationalist and hilarious), watched Anora, did adult activities, and I cooked her and I dinner before she left near midnight. So all in all, it seems like she’s really into me, even though she gives off the vibe of being a more casual dater. 

My experience is that I usually am not the casual dater. I tend to move fast and be the anxious attached person, wanting to put labels and structure on things, but thanks to therapy I’m a lot better about it. That said, the way we spent time together felt more romantic than pure “hit it and quit it”. So I don’t want to romanticize but I’m hopeful. Either way I’m not sure when would be appropriate to text her again. She’s much more chatty in person (so she doesn’t seem the texting type), and the last exchange we had was last night with us both saying we had a good time and thanking each other for it. 

Because I’ve been burned before and this all seems to too good be true, I’m overthinking when to reach out again. Should I give it some time? Would it be desperate or show healthy pursuit to text her again today and ask when I could see her again? Someone please bring me down to earth. ",I Need Advice 😩,16,12,2025-03-31 14:57:50

relationships,My (24F) boyfriend (25M) of 5.5 years is starting to resent me for having to take care of me since I broke my foot. Advice?,"Hello! I am getting pretty stressed about my relationship status as I fractured my foot 2.5 weeks ago and haven’t been able to walk since, so I have been majorly relying on my boyfriend of nearly 6 years. I want to preface this by saying he has been extremely helpful the last few weeks and has even been driving me to and from work. Additionally, our lease ended on our old apartment over the weekend so we were in the process of moving to our new apartment starting 3/29. 

Within the first week of my injury he had a breakdown about how he doesn’t get any time for himself and has been doing everything around the apartment, which I obviously felt terrible about but there wasn’t much I could do since I was on crutches. I got concerned that he was that stressed out already considering it hadn’t even been a week yet, so I enlisted the help of my mom to fly across the country to help pack up my things for the move & clean the apartment to lighten the load on him. My mom was here for about a week and really helped with pretty much all of my belongings & even did his laundry to ease his responsibilities. 

Within that time period, I found out I may need surgery and my boyfriend immediately broke down and left the apartment to get some alone time (still week 1 of my injury). He came back and apologized and said he was just stressed that this would prolong my injury, which I obviously was stressed about too since it’s my foot. 

Fast forward to the move-in weekend and it was all around a shit show since our movers cancelled on us day of so we had to hire last minute movers. All day, my bf keeps snapping at me and yelling pretty much whenever I opened my mouth to the point I cried multiple times that day, but again knew he was doing so much for me in handling the move. 

We finally get moved into our apartment and I’m doing my best to do my part to unpack, but it’s challenging as I’m still in a boot and using a knee scooter. Every night has been hell for me since he keeps snapping at me and making me feel like shit, but I know there’s nothing I can say since he’s taking care of me and driving me to/from work. 

Key point in story: We were supposed to go to a concert this weekend and I expressed my concern about my foot and that pretty much sent him over the edge as he said “you know how important this concert is to me and I would think that after everything i’ve done for you the last few weeks you would try to figure out a way to make it work”. Keep in mind the concert is at a casino that will require a lot of walking and stairs to get to our seats. I gave in and said yes to the concert since he’s making me feel like I owe him, but I’m really anxious about how it’s going to go since I still can’t walk.

I have been trying to be patient and understanding since I know how stressful the last few weeks have been and how he’s had to do a lot for me, but I’m getting to my breaking point as this injury has obviously not been easy on me either. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR - My bf has been taking care of me the last 2.5 weeks due to broken foot & has been really stressed and taking it out on me. He guilted me into agreeing to a concert by basically saying I owe him after all he’s done for me even though I can’t walk. 

Edit: Wow I didn’t expect this post to gain so much traction and am honestly extremely overwhelmed reading all the comments so that’s why I have not fully replied yet, but I see and appreciate everything. Thanks everyone for the advice and for sharing your stories. I definitely have a lot to think about and really appreciate y’all taking the time to respond.  ",,136,208,2025-04-03 16:06:25
relationships,Husband blames me for treating me poorly," I (29F) wrote a lengthy text to my husband (32M) about how hurt I’ve been feeling about the way he treats me and unmet needs. 

I expressed how I was feeling and he immediately responded with, in summary “I’m sorry I made you feel that way. You don’t deserve that. It’s clear we are both unhappy here. We should have a conversation about if/ how we can fix this”. 

I thanked him for saying that and that I was open to that conversation. 24 hours went by and we didn’t speak to each other, despite living under the same roof. 

I sent him a follow-up asking if he’s had a chance to think about the things I mentioned and if he is able to address them. I told him I won’t rush him and to let me know when he’s ready to discuss. 

We speak over the phone and he basically tells me the reason he treats me the way he does is because I make him. When I do something to piss him off, annoy him or bother him in someway - that is what triggers him to call me names and be disrespectful. When he is in that “mode” that’s why he is so hypercritical of me and constantly putting me down. 

I asked him if that’s something he can work on and he basically says it’s a me problem and I need to stop triggering him - basically explaining that the problem is my “masculine energy”. He says I need to work on being more feminine. 

He also mentioned the way that text message was positioned, it felt like I was just listing all the things that are wrong with him. Maybe that made him feel attacked. Maybe I could have positioned it more effectively

Obviously coming out of this i feel like shit and I know most of you will say to leave him but I’m flawed too. I am a lot to deal with. I suffer with ADHD which makes me hypersensitive, emotional and just overall difficult. 

The reason I am here is to get help understanding the situation from a 3rd person perspective. 


TL;DR: husband blames me for his actions when he hurts my feelings. Wife suffers with ADHD and understands she is hard to deal with. Looking for thoughts on the situation. Is it possible for the relationship to survive?",,9,33,2025-04-03 17:41:33

Got a taxi back to parents and then found out he had been cheating which makes me feel so incredibly sick, rang him confronting him about it and he did the whole “I’m so sorry, I feel awful, I don’t deserve you” blah blah blah. I don’t know how to feel now though. Obviously I loved him but I had been hiding the abuse for months and months. It was never physical but he’s a scary man and put me down, ruined my self esteem and punched walls, shouted and threatened me on a regular basis.

relationships,My (29F) boyfriend (48M) says I start all our arguments and blames me for our problems. Is it really my fault?,"Lately, my (29F) boyfriend (48M) and I have been arguing a lot. Yesterday, he told me I’m the cause of all our problems and that I provoke every argument. He’s always kind of implied it, but hearing him say it so directly really hurt. He also called me a liar (im not sure about what anymore i asked him but he didn't really answer), and overly sensitive. That stung. So I asked him, “Is that really all you see in me? If I’m causing all the problems, why do you even want to be with me?” I wasn’t trying to start another fight—I genuinely wanted to understand. But now, I don’t know what to think.

Is it really my fault? I told him that arguments shouldn’t be about blame but about working through things together. But he just kept saying, “You like arguing, don’t you?” and “You start all the fights.” He’s generally a kind person, but sometimes, I don’t feel that kindness from him.

I couldn’t sleep last night. I kept replaying everything, wondering if I could’ve handled things better. I did say something hurtful too, and I feel guilty. I pointed out that he has a pattern of blaming his exes for his past failed relationships. He told me that before, it was always his exes, but it wasn’t fair of me to bring that up.

I also hold onto certain things. Like the time we had an argument on holiday—I walked off and sat by the sidewalk crying, and he took pictures of me while sitting next to me smiling at his phonecamera. When I asked why, he said it was ""to show me how I ruined his evening."" That moment still lingers, and sometimes, I bring it up because he never really apologized.

I’ve noticed I cry more easily now. It might be dramatic, but sometimes i can't help it. Last night, when he was ignoring me and tried to leave, I said, “If you leave now, it’s over.” I know that was toxic, and I apologized after, but I was just hurt cause he was ignoring me.

I’m scared I’m being too insecure—or even narcissistic. I want to be better, but I don’t know how. And as much as I feel lost in this relationship, leaving feels impossible. I love him too much, and if I left, I know he’d never let me see his dogs again. I love them dearly, and the thought of losing them too just breaks me even more.

TL;DR;  
boyfriend blames me for all our arguments, calling me overly sensitive and a liar. Some past hurtful moments still linger but I’ve made mistakes too and worry I’m being too insecure or narcissistic. I want to be better and don't know how.",,60,105,2025-04-03 06:38:19

I realised it wasn’t on me after few hours of being with him, I tried to calm myself down and thought i put it into my purse, or anywhere else, maybe i just thought of putting it into my pocket and forgot it at home. But when i got home it wasn’t anywhere. I’m thinking of retracing my steps and try to look for it, but it has been hours since we went out.

relationships,I (20M) and current gf (20F) are having trust and betrayal issues. Deciding to stay or move on.,"So this all started because me and my gf of 3 years had a rough patch and we decided to take a short break from each other and to promise to focus on ourselves and keep in touch.

I went back home to my family and I found out two days later she went to the movies with her baby daddy who isn't even in the picture much and she tells me how much she hated him and doesn't like being around him. I asked her who she went with and she lied and said her mom and I told her I knew who it really was. I had her location still and her phone was dead at the movies and she didn't get home until 12 at night so I didn't know where she went before hand. She told me she was sorry and she didn't do anything but the lies shes been telling me make me not believe her. She told me it was nothing and she went becuse she had to go since the baby daddy bought the kid a ticket even though it wasn't his weekend.

Also found out also they were following each other on most socials as we got into our break but I never told her about it and seeing if she'll end up telling me or not. I told her I did everything for you and your kid while you can stay home with your kid and this is how you show me appreciation and she stayed quiet so not sure if she truly sees the betrayal I felt. So my question is what can I do about this problem? TL;DR",,0,0,2025-04-03 23:54:08
relationships,How do I (25F) and my boyfriend (24M) work on our trust issues?,"We've been together almost 3 years and have a LO less than a year. 
We've been dealing with trust issues for a while now. I struggle with trust issues in general. 
There is no intimacy like kissing passionately or hugging especially when I'm upset, or genuine care it feels like. Just sex and no kissing still, and he says bc of no trust which I understand. He's not willing to communicate about anything though and says I don't make an effort either but I'm the one trying to talk things out calmly to get to a resolution. 
Backstory- He's cheated over text (after my 1st MC) and claims I have when an old flame id say, reached out to me to hang out and said I'd get back to him on that. Yes I could have said no I'm seeing someone but I didn't regretfully. I wasn't sexting or even texting that person except that reply when he messaged me again but on IG. This guy actually cared about me,not just to get in my pants. Since then, our relationship has been rocky. 
I want us to work out honestly.
I get it, accusing him of cheating isn't the best but I have such a gut feeling but idk if I'm mixing it with just trust issues. He thinks I am because I accuse him of it but because of his behavior! I've read that usually the one cheating will project themselves onto their SO, but I'm not or have been. I would rather just know straight up.

relationships,What Should I Do?,"Hi y'all,

This is a bit challenging for me to share, but my girlfriend (20F) and I (23M) need to have a talk about her hygiene. I NEVER use the word ""ick""  (and wouldn’t ever w her) but she has been giving me that for the past 1.5 months. We've been dating since VDay, which was our 1 month. I really do love this girl (though I'm not sure I love her as much as she loves me), am very attracted to her in SO MANY ways, I love her family, and I want to stick around to continue seeing if our love grows. But parts of her hygiene give me MASSIVE icks-such as her breath, and overall poor dental hygiene, as well as the fact that there has been a bit of an odor down there (which l've noticed during oral and vaginal sex).

It's so much so to the point where I've recently been thinking about ending things. She is a sweetheart and treats me very well, and we complement each other in many ways.

It is difficult be she is very sensitive, even when I give general feedback thoughtfully and emphatically (I'm a social worker). I'm also sensitive, so I do understand.

An overall theme is that it is hard for her being direct w giving/receiving feedback. She used a hypothetical example a while back where I BELIEVE the situation would call for sweet, compassionate, thoughtful, direct communication, but she said to just not say anything. I don't remember what the example was, but let's use the spinach-stuck-in-teeth as an analogy (personally I’d want to know). I acknowledge that timing is important to consider as well.

One real example was when we were getting dressed for a formal event, and we were already in a time crunch to take group pictures (which don’t really matter). As we had showered the night before, her hair looked a bit oily. In a calm, sweet manner, I communicated this with her, as she wasn’t planning to shower beforehand, especially because she worries about the perceptions of others, especially girls. She was hurt and upset with me, and wished I hadn’t said anything. I communicated that I love her enough to give direct (yet sweet) feedback to her, even if upsetting.

I fear pushing her away if I express my needs/be direct (again, yet sweet) which is her for her to practice better overall hygiene (floss, drink more water, gum, washing better), bc 1.) health is important to me and 2.) it is making me lose feelings/attraction.

Somebody please help a brotha out. How should I respond?

relationships,Seeking advice 27M for a situationship with 25f," So basically i was i a situationship where the girl wanted something serious with me and i kept denying her , and i treated her very poorly in the last three months , fights almost everyday etc, now 10 days ago she came up and said that she liked someone else and she wants to stop everything with me! 

Now the problem is that i have developed feelings for her and am ready to give her the commitment that she wants but she said she doesn't see my in that way. She said that she is confused and wants to give the other guy 'a fair chance' but things can happen between us in future, but she said that keeping me in her life as her friends is her top priority . 

She is leaving for studies after 6 months outside country. i kept asking her to choose one thing and be honest with me about it, today she finally said that things are too late between us and i should move on, but i have requested (begged rather) her to give us another fair chance. And she said she will think and let me know tomorrow!

relationships,How do I (31 F) get rid of this woman (60 F) from my life (aunt)?,"Please I can't post anuwhere else. I (31 F), live alone. Don't have contact with family except my parents and siblings. Aunts, uncles, cousins all know the score. Nobody tries to contact me because they know I won't bother. Reasons are too long to get into but I live a different life to extended family and never see them, nor do I want to. I cannot make that clear enough.

Every birthday, one aunt (60 F) messages happy birthday and I do not reply. I have made it clear I want nothing to do with her before anyone asks if I have told her. She doesn't care. She will use my birthday as the opportunity to cause drama when I don't reply. She phones up my parents, gets them to tell me I need to explain AGAIN, says she's ""hurt."" I know she's lying, she's just trying to get back in my life. She's that person who can't accept you're different, been like this my whole life. Loud, drinks a lot, interferes in your relationships, embarrassed me in front of previous partners. I tell her nothing and told my parents not to. I stay away from her in every way and even live 3 hours away. I never see her.

I have blocked her in EVERY way on every platform. She uses her boyfriend's phone to text me. I blocked that number. A year later she used her son's phone to text me.

I simply refused to text thank you and my parents said why don't you just say thank you once a year, and it'll sort the problem out? I'm now not talking to my parents. No one understands, I don't WANT TO. Nobody else hounds me this much, why should the rule be different for her. And I know she won't leave it at that, she will use it to get in my life again. What do I do?

  
TL; DR Aunt (60 F) won't leave me (31 F) alone and uses other people's phones to wish me happy birthday every year, even though I blocked her on everything. Parents said I should say thank you, but I want zero contact.",,0,6,2025-04-03 21:42:24
relationships,Coworker issues,"Not sure if this belongs here as it is about a coworker, but here goes. I (28F) work with a team of 6 people all with the same position title and role at our job. For about the past 4-5 months, one of my coworkers from the team, Olivia (30F), has been acting completely neurotic, arrogant, and toxic. I used to consider Olivia a pretty good friend and we would hang out a lot outside of work and I actually shared a lot of personal stuff I was going through with her since I felt like she was trustworthy and would not judge.

Olivia has seemed to be on a decline for several months now; she has had numerous unsuccessful relationships, her performance reports have not been good, and struggles a lot with substance use. Her mental decline has become everyone at work's problem, which has pushed me away from her and made her an unpleasant person to be around. She self-proclaimed herself as the head of our team after having been at our company the longest (despite not having the most experience or the best performance reports) and presents herself that way to everyone else in our company. 

She takes over our meetings, tells us how to do our jobs, and talks at us at all times of the day. I have not been able to finish my work at work, because she has taken up so much of my time by talking at me that I can't get anything done. When having a conversation, it is completely one-sided and everything is about her. She asks a question, then finds a way to interrupt the person answering it and brings it back to being about her. When she enters the room, she instantly commands all of the energy, makes the attention go to her, and turns everything into pure chaos. Part of me feels bad, because this woman is so starved for attention that she resorts to forcing everyone at work to give it to her. She has no hobbies outside of work and spends her time at home smoking and drinking, but complains about how bad her life is and that she can't find a guy to be with her. All of her problems, whether work or personal, are made to be our problems. Our other coworkers deliberately exclude her from parties or hanging out after work because almost everyone else doesn't like her. In an effort to get more work done, I've moved myself to different places around the office, but she follows me every time. To be honest, it's exhausting and I can't imagine how I'm going to function in the future with this going on. 

Olivia also acts like she is the best at our job and constantly puts herself on a pedestal as a model for what the rest of us should be doing. She told our team that she's simply going to be more successful here because she's been here longer and the bosses like her better. When we have meetings with our bosses, she talks the entire time, saying things we don't agree with, and makes us all look bad because she is speaking on our behalf. She interrupts us while we work to give unsolicited advice or critique what we're doing. I simply can't function like this at work and have considered leaving mostly because of this.

Now for the reasoning of this post. Obviously something needs to change for this to be sustainable. All of my coworkers are frustrated by Olivia's behavior, and some are doing even worse with it than I am. I have thought about confronting her multiple times, but due to her mental state, I worry that any type of confrontation would absolutely destroy her. As someone who was a good friend, I do care about her and feel bad to see her suffering like this, since her behavior is clearly rooted in some deep insecurity and need for love and attention. I just don't know how to bring up her behavior without crushing her. She would definitely hate me, and could make my life at work even more miserable. I told her that it could be really helpful for her to talk to someone in a therapy setting, but it's unclear whether she will take that on. I also don't want to go over her head and complain to our bosses, since that would also be devastating for her. She seems to be pretty aware of her flaws, but has said that she doesn't plan on changing and that anyone who doesn't get along with her doesn't have to be in her life. I want to be there for her and listen when she shares her struggles, but I just can't find it in me to do that right now. 

How can my coworkers and I address her unpleasant behavior without offending or upsetting her? I can't continue to work under someone who self-appointed herself as my boss and sucks all of my energy out before my lunch break even hits. 

TL;DR: My coworker is unpleasant, acts like my boss, and is struggling mentally. I want to address her behavior without hurting her feelings. ",,1,1,2025-04-03 21:15:21
relationships,My GF is seeking reassurance around our relationship,"I’m 35M and have been dating someone who’s 31F. It’s been about four months now.

The first month felt good - we were getting to know each other, spending time both at work and sometimes after hours since we’re colleagues. Things felt easy. In the second month, I even told her that if everything continued going well, I’d introduce her to my sister.

During the 2nd month I observed, some traits where she spoke about not continuing because I was not providing her reassurance (about emotional safety and reassurance of long term and introducing to family), this has created a big mess and emotional turmoil in our relationship. Hence I wanted more time to introduce her to my sister.

I started noticing small shifts - she began reacting strongly to minor things, getting upset when things didn’t go her way.

I understood where she was coming from, and I genuinely wanted to make things work. I stayed, hoping we’d figure it out together.

But emotionally, it’s been sliding for both of us. We’re still trying, but something feels off - like we’re not able to meet each other where we need to.

TL;DR - Few positives during this time:  
\- moved houses to stay around my area, so that we can meet often  
\- celebrated my birthday for a week, made plans by herself  
\- she did give me gifts in between every month, and vice versa from my side

\- Our fun times are very happy, at the same time when things are south its worse

P.s: Myself never married, She has been divorced earlier, she also told me she has gone through childhood trauma.

Please advise, what should I do? Please ask me questions for any clarity, I might not be great with writing content, Thank you.",,1,29,2025-04-03 21:02:53
relationships,My (20M) girlfriend (18F) suddenly became distant after a great week together.,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 months. Last past week was amazing—we had a great date filled with laughter and were texting regularly. However, yesterday morning, after a lot of texting, she suddenly became distant. Later in the day, she just liked my message instead of replying. When I asked if something was wrong, she said she has a big problem and wants to be alone.​

I know there aren't any family issues, as I've seen her father and everyone seems to be in a good mood. She recently started her menstrual cycle and has been feeling down about her appearance, often saying she's fat, even though she's actually quite skinny. She also has past trauma that sometimes affects her mood. I tried to comfort her, but it didn't seem to help.​

Lately, I've been busy with my job and part-time work, which limited our communication. When I became more available, she seemed very needy and wanted to text a lot, which we did.​

She kept me on her close friends list on Instagram and was posting her usual content. However, later in the day, she deactivated her Instagram account, only to reactivate it an hour later and reach out to me on WhatsApp. We also had plans, but she canceled them. Now, she just likes my messages without replying, and I have no idea what's going on.​

I'd love to understand, but if she keeps ignoring me and doesn't reach out in a few days on her own, I feel like it might be time to move on. Any advice?​

relationships,i think my sister hates my boyfriend and i need advice,"
i’m gonna try and make this as short and sweet as possible 

I F(20) and my boyfriend M(20) have been together going on 5 years this year, we met when we were both 15 and in the 10th grade. When we were teenagers we were dumb and stupid and snuck around (which i think most teenagers do at some point with strict parents) my mom was always strict on me and my boyfriend has a chill mom, so in order to see him when i wanted to i had to sneak around and i snuck him in one day when we were 17 and obviously we got caught lol, my mom found us and she immediately ran and told my older sister (my sister and i have a 17 year age gap) they also both found out that him and i were sexually active (my mom and my sister are both very religious and are the type that insisted that if i have sex before marriage then I’m a disappointment basically) anyway, we got through that, it’s been 4 years since then and my bf and i are much older, more mature etc. But my sister has never gotten over it, she holds this constant grudge against him and even said i must make sure he stays very very far away from her, anytime we have an argument she somehow always drags my bf into it and says i spend too much time with him and she’s not gonna sit by and watch someone that takes advantage of women (he obviously does not take advantage of me, if he did i would not still be with him today) it’s very clear she has a problem with him but she’s now influencing that on my mom too, i have no idea what to do but i know i’m not gonna break up with my bf, he makes me so happy and he’s my escape from my house and everything going on in it, he is the sweetest person ever and he has the most respect for me that anyone has ever had, (also side note i’ve never once spoken to her or my mother about any issues or problems my bf has had in our relationship, i keep that very private and between me and him and he does the same) it just sucks that my sister is so stuck on the past that she doesn’t even want anything to do with him. i don’t know what to do and i could really use some advice. thank you. 

TL;DR: I (20F) have been with my boyfriend (20M) for almost 5 years. We’ve been through a lot, including sneaking around when we were teenagers and getting caught by my strict mom and older sister. My mom and sister both found out we were sexually active, and they’ve held that against my boyfriend ever since. Despite us being older and more mature now, my sister still has a grudge against him and constantly drags him into arguments, accusing him of taking advantage of me (which is not true or else i wouldn’t be with him). She’s even influencing my mom’s opinion of him. I don’t want to break up with him; he makes me happy and is nothing but respectful toward me. It’s hard because my sister can’t let go of the past, and it’s affecting my relationship with my family. Any advice on how to handle this?",,1,2,2025-04-03 20:53:50
relationships,My boyfriend (M20) keeps lying to me (F20),"TL;DR My partner and I have been together for a few months, but a couple of weeks ago, we broke up for several reasons—one of them being his repeated lying about looking at other women on Twitter. I had voiced my feelings about this multiple times, but he kept doing it anyway. This time, it led to us actually breaking up.

Eventually, we reconciled and agreed on a compromise: watching adult content on sites like Pornhub was fine, but looking at half-naked or naked women on social media—where he could easily interact with them—was not. He assured me that he was okay with this and even promised to stop using Twitter altogether.

For weeks, he has repeatedly reassured me that he wasn’t on Twitter, but today I found out he’s been lying about it the entire time. At this point, it’s not even about the women anymore—it’s about the constant dishonesty. I would have much preferred if he had just told me the truth instead of continuously lying to my face. It really hurts to know that someone I love can look me in the eye and lie to me for months.

Now, I’m struggling with how to bring it up. Despite everything, I still love him deeply and don’t want to lose him, but no matter what, I’m the one left feeling hurt. I just need some advice on how to handle this situation.",,1,9,2025-04-03 20:08:34
relationships,My (25/M) girlfriend (24/F) doesn’t initiate any form of physical contact,"I’ve been seeing my (25/M) girlfriend, Megan (24/F) for 12 weeks now. 6 weeks of officially having the label. And we are in a friend group that became close about 6-7 months ago. 

Megan was always a shy person and a little anxious. She’s never had a boyfriend. I’ve been trying to be patient with her but up until this point I have been initiating 100% of physical contact. Literally 100%. We have not had sex yet either. 

2-3 weeks ago I asked her “ I was wondering, do you like physical affection? I was never sure if you do like when I grab your hand and stuff. Or if I was over doing it. “ she said she liked physical affection and that I was not over doing it. I was hoping after this convo she would pick it up a little. And it basically hasn’t. And I’m starting to get frustrated because I love physical affection (which I’ve told her 2-3 times) and it just feels like there’s hardly any “romance” in the air. 

There’s only been one time she’s shown she truly wanted physical contact from me and that’s when she was really drunk at a bar with our friends like two months ago. She asked why I hadn’t kissed her yet, wanted me to give her a leg massage and jumped on my back to carry her to the next bar. Which I loved doing. 

I don’t expect, nor want, over the top physical affection. I just want her to grab my hand here and there, put her hand on my back or just do the bare minimum with physical affection. I’ve been with a few girls and I’ve never had this issue. 

I know everyone will say talk to her, but at the same time I want it so badly to happen naturally because I don’t want her to feel like she has to or that it’s a requirement. I want her to desire me. If I didn’t initiate anything then every time we see each other it would just be a quick kiss hello and goodbye followed by a quick hug and that would be it, nothing else. 

I’m not sure if I’m just being impatient, but I just feel like after 12 weeks, if she isn’t showing even the bare minimum of physical affection, something has to be up. Everything else besides affection has been good. How can I proceed with her without making her feel like she HAS TO show physical affection and to find out if she even wants to show me physical affection? I’m tempted to just stop touching her and seeing if she even notices. 

TL;DR: my (25/M) girlfriend (24/F) of 3 months doesn’t initiate any form of physical contact and it’s starting to get to me. How can I proceed to change things around (if that’s possible)?

relationships,My feelings come and go for my girlfriend,"**Edited because previous was removed**

Hi! So apparently, I (19M) have completely lost it and can't find what's right or wrong in my situation, so I'm trying on here.

My girlfriend and I, both 19, have been together since we were 16, though we had a little break for about 2 months when we were 17(my decision). I love her so much and honestly feel like an idiot for having to go here, but it is like a literal rollercoaster, one week I could be madly in love with her, and the next week I won't even wanna talk to her. and I know it's affecting her because when I'm in that period of just wanting to be alone and not wanting to be around her she sometimes ask me if there's anything wrong but I just say no.

sometimes these periods are worse than others, it's going right now and it has lasted for quite some time now, and honestly, I just think we should end it, but what if the next week I'll regret it and wanna get back together, that's why I've been having this problem for about a year, I don't wanna hurt her and I do not want to do something I'm going to regret but right now i really feel like its time to end it.

relationships,I (27F) My fiancé(29M)'s Ex(30F) still calls him 'Babe'. Am I overreacting?,"Me(27F) And my fiancé(27M), together 4 years, engaged 6months. His ex(30F) was with him for 5 years before they split.

I never thought I'd be the kind of person to feel weird about something like this, but here I am, questioning myself. I've always believed in trust, and I genuinely don't have issue with my fiancé staying friend with his ex. But the fact  that she still calls him babe? That's been bothering me way more than expected.

For some context, my fiancé and his ex were together for about 5 years before breaking up. It wasn't a dramatic split, just one of these as a better friends situations. They stayed in touch, which never really concerned me. He told  me early on in our relationship that they still talk occasionally, and I appreciated his honesty. I even met her once at a mutual friend's event, she was nice.

A few weeks ago though I overhead a phone call between them. He was on speaker while getting something from kitchen, and their conversation seemed casual , catching up about work, life, etc. But then she laughed and said something like, Oh, you always do that babe! just like that my stomach flipped,.

I didn't say anything right away because I didn't want to react emotionally. But later that night, i bought it up, trying to be as calm as possible. I said, Hey, i noticed she called you babe on the phone today Is that normal? He kindly said that, Yeah she's always called me that. It doesn't mean anything. I asked if he thought it was a little weird now that he's engaged and he said, I don't really think about that. its just a habit.

And thats where i stuck to him. to me it feels off. I trust him completely, and i dont think tere's anything shady going on. But i also feel like there should be a natural shift in boundaries when you're engaged to someone else. Would she call him that in front of me? Would she still do it if i wasn't in the picture? And why he hasn't ever thought to tell her, maybe let's retire the pet names i am engaged now.

I don't want to be controlling or come across as insecure, but i also don't think I'm being unreasonable. Its's not even about the word babe itself, it's all about the familiarity it implies. If the roles were reversed than i think he'd find it weird too.

So,do i bring it up again and ask him to set boundaries? or do i let it go and trust that it really just a habit/ I don't even want to turn this into a bigger deal than it is, but i don't want to ignore something that genuinely bothers me.

TL;DR: My fiance's ex still calls him babe, and he says it's just habit. It makes me uncomfortable, but I don't want to overreact. Should I ask him to set a boundary, or am I making something out of nothing.",,278,61,2025-04-02 12:08:38
relationships,"Title: [F21] My [M23] boyfriend and I agreed to live separately on weekdays. I feel grief, anxiety, and emotional distance, what should I do to feel more secure in the relationship?","Hi Reddit,

I’ve (F21) been in a relationship with my boyfriend (M23) for about 6 months. We both have our own apartments, and recently we agreed to live separately on weekdays to focus on personal growth and building individuality. We still spend time together on weekends. I supported the idea at first, but ever since his sister told him she doesn’t like me, I can’t help but feel that’s what really triggered the shift.

Since then, I’ve been feeling distant and anxious. I’ve expressed my needs to him a few times, but I often feel like he doesn’t fully understand how deeply this is affecting me. I told him I don’t date unless it’s intentional, and he said he wants to marry me after college, have kids, etc. — but sometimes it feels like he just agrees with me to end the conversation.

Last night, I got overwhelmed and asked him to come over because I was having anxiety. He did, which I appreciated. But when I tried to talk to him about my feelings, I didn’t feel fully heard. After he left, I called and texted to check on him — and he didn’t respond until the next day. He said he overslept and missed his clients. I know he’s stressed, but I still felt dismissed.

The thing is, I love him and want this to work. But I’ve been feeling a lot of grief, like I’m mourning something that hasn’t ended. I started therapy this week, and I know I can be codependent — but I also know I deserve to feel emotionally safe and chosen.

What should I do to feel more emotionally secure in the relationship?
How do I balance being supportive of his stress without abandoning my own needs for connection and reassurance?

Any advice would be really appreciated. I’m trying to grow through this, not just sit in it.

TL;DR:
I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) decided to live apart on weekdays for personal growth, but I think the real reason was pressure from his sister who doesn’t like me. Ever since, I’ve felt more anxious and emotionally disconnected. I love him, but I’m struggling with feeling grief even though we’re still together. What can I do to feel more secure in this relationship?

relationships,Is my LTR between my boyfriend (28M) and I (24F) salvageable?,"    **TL;DR;** : My boyfriend and I have acknowledged that our connection is less strong than it used to be. Some things he said make me wonder if the relationship isn't already over. Is my relationship salvageable?

I (24F) have been in a relationship with my partner (28M) for over 5 years. We live together and have built a life. He makes me laugh, and I love being with him, but things have been different in the past year, and we finally acknowledged it.

For context, I work a very demanding job requiring a lot of time investment and short notice work. Meanwhile, my partner is still in school and is in quite a bit of debt (this is relevant later), so I cover a lot of our major expenses (namely rent, vet bills, emergencies, etc.).

Over the past two or so years, we've been really bad at planning dates and going out together. The times that we have talked about it, we often turned to finances as the reason why, making plans for when we have money and disposable income. But this increasingly feels like a cop out, especially as I would often propose free or cheap date ideas that he wouldn't be up for.

We've been fighting a lot more. Small, little issues escalate and become big blowouts, and this past week was rock bottom. We had a dumb argument about sharing kitchen space. No mean words were ever exchanged, but we both escalated it in tone and by storming out of the kitchen when we got too frustrated. When he left for work, I found myself sobbing into the carpet, feeling like something had finally broke. I was so overwhelmed that I texted him to ask if he wanted to break up and he assured me he didn't but that we needed to have a long talk about our communication and why this pattern keeps happening.

I pulled myself together and went to work. Mid-way through the day, I got a message from him which was a lengthy letter that he wrote on the Notes app. It expressed how hurt this cycle was making him, how he deemed it important to address now before continuing to build a life together (a family), but also how in his mind, the main issue was how I picked fights without warning or care for how I talked to him.

I took time to think and wrote him a letter back, which expressed things from my perspective, which is how I feel like we have both lost a bit of patience for the other and that our connection is lacking. When we eventually had a long deep talk that night, he agreed with the connection issue. We started to explore why that could be and he said it's because our interactions are ""junk domestic interactions"" and that we don't prioritize quality over quantity. He said we both need to make an effort to put our best foot forward for the other person.

This is where my heart really broke, because I told him that I felt like I have been doing that. I feel a measure of guilt about how much I work and the whole finances question, so I really try to make sure I'm proposing activities and showing interest in his hobbies. So I told him that I felt like I do try. After a few seconds of thought, he said he agreed that I was the main try-er and that sometimes he found it off-putting. He said he felt like it was inauthentic at times and just generally that you can't keep desiring a person that you don't believe would ever leave you in a million years, would ever walk away. I'm not remembering the words exactly. I'm sure it was worded nicer than this, but this feeling was the takeaway. And when I said that I felt like he didn't ask me about my passions much, he asked me what my passions were outside of work. This also really hurt, as I have been struggling with a sense of unfulfillment for a while. I keep telling myself I'm young, and it's normal to be confused, but his question (though sincere) cut really deep.

At first, I felt optimistic about our conversation, because it felt like a good sign that we could open up this much. But as time passes, I wonder whether we're just keeping something alive that is already dying. I love him very much and can easily picture the rest of my life with him. But I'm starting to wonder if he feels the same way. Is my relationship salvageable?",,0,1,2025-04-03 16:39:24
relationships,"I’m (21FTM) thinking about breaking up with my bf (31M), should I?","Well, plain and simple, we’ve been dating for a little over a year, he’s just been distant lately, he says it’s because of his home and work life, he was very sweet and affectionate before, not anymore now, I realized I was the only one who plans stuff, and i started thinking about breaking up when all he did for my birthday was send me a “happy birthday” text when I went out of my way to make him feel special in his, I feel my love for him is one sided.

I also caught him commenting flirty stuff once, when I confronted him about it he apologized and promised not to do it again and for his credit he didn’t, as far as I know.

Also something that really bothers me that he hasn’t been sexual with me for months, he also blames it on his work and home life but also his low testosterone, but he follows a lot of lewd accounts on instagram and comments frequently on posts, saying he’d go to war for hot fictional characters, he also barely comments on my posts and doesn’t talk about me or being in a relationship, which also bothers me, he only commented on a post once, there was also an incident where he deleted a comment I made on one of his posts and said he tried to pin it but accidentally deleted it cause he was drunk.

And it’s just, I feel really unloved, he does let me rant and reassure me about being pretty and that he loves me but I’m not sure if that’s true, i feel like he bears with me because I’m the only option he has for now, and that he’ll leave me for someone better if they come along.

Should I break up with him or am i overthinking this?

Should I wait for him to feel better and give him time?

She just wants to stay at her home and that’s that. The thing is I understand she needs space. But I told her since she keeps canceling on me she needs to reach out when she wants to hang out. The thing is that could be a week or longer. It makes me feel inadequate and it’s hard for me to be strong for her cause I just wanna physically be there for her. How do I approach this situation?

relationships,Friend group invited us on a trip but intentionally didn’t invite two ‘best” friends for unknown reasons,"BACKGROUND:  My husband (M59) and I (M70) have a friend group (all older gay Males ages 55-75) that we travel on occasion.  There are five couples (all married) in our friend group.  Sometimes we travel together as a group and sometimes we travel with one or two other couples.  My husband and I are the newest 
“members” of this friend group.  Everyone else has been friends for quite a long while and everyone seems (seemed?) to get along very well.  We really enjoy spending time with all these guys

PROBLEM:  We were invited by one of the guys to join them on a trip to a European destination over the summer to celebrate his husband’s milestone birthday coming up.  We checked our schedules and immediately said yes, we’d love to join them.  A goup text thread was started with everyone who’s planning on going when we noticed that two of our closest friends in the group (M64 and M60) were not on the chat list.  We’ll call them Paul and David.  It was Paul and David who originally introduced us to the rest their friends.  All of these guys have been friends for years, making us the two “newest members” so to speak.  When I didn’t see Paul and David’s name on the list, we assumed they couldn’t make the trip for whatever reason but we later found out that Paul and David weren’t invited.  

We’ve no idea why Paul and David weren’t invited and it feels awkward to ask.  It also has put us in a very awkward situation because out of all the guys in the group, we socialize most with Paul and David as they live closest to us.  Obviously we can’t discuss the upcoming trip with them and when they find out about it, I know they’ll be really hurt and angry.  We honestly don’t feel comfortable enough to reach out to the birthday trip organizer to ask what’s going on - why wasn’t Paul and David invited - but not inviting them is going to put my husband an I in a bad spot, not to mention how hurt they’ll be when they find out that they were not invited by their old friends but we were.  At the same time, we can’t tell the organizer who to invite and who not to invite.  It’s just going to be one big mess.  

Finally, I do know that Paul and David are currently completely unaware of this pending trip.  We were hoping that they had been asked but said no, they couldn’t make it but that is not the case.  This will all be a complete surprise to them.  At this stage of my life, I normally feel pretty confident about handling awkward social situations but this one has me stumped.  We’re considering not going for the sake of our friendship with Paul and David but we’re really looking forward to this trip to someplace we’d always wanted to visit.  Any thoughts on how to handle this?  My apologies for the long post.  

TL/DR:  Friend group planning a birthday celebration in a European destination.  We got invited but two good friends did not.  We met this friend group through the two guys who did not get invited making this completely awkward.  ",,9,21,2025-04-03 04:21:03
relationships,My (F31) partner (M34) and I work very different jobs (with different pay) and I think he is building resentment toward me because of it. How do I stop this from impacting our relationship?,"I am 31F and my partner is 34M. We've been together 2.5 years, we live together, and for the most part we have a very happy and healthy relationship. We are best friends, we have lots of trust, we've navigated conflict well when it comes up, all green flags. 

When we first started dating, we were in very similar places financially. He is a teacher and I worked doing mental health therapy at a non-profit. We made almost the exact same salary, and we were able to share with each other a lot of our workplace frustrations to do with navigating under-resourced systems, burnout, and compassion fatigue. 

I was mid-way through grad school when we met and finished my degree last year. I went back to school because I knew I did not want to work as a therapist for my entire life. Getting my degree allowed me to pivot to a new job in consulting about six months ago. My partner was fully supportive of me making the switch, helped me prepare for my interview and helped me celebrate when I landed the position. 

So here is where things get awkward: My new job is fully remote, significantly higher paying, and less people-facing so it results in a LOT less stress. I also lucked out with a manager who is very hands-off, who essentially lets us work whenever we like so long as we complete our tasks. This is great for me but it is basically the opposite of the environment my partner is in at his job.

My partner is an amazing teacher but as we know, teachers are not valued the way they should be. He has to be at work, in person and at the front of the classroom every day, he has to manage  disruptive students, lesson planning, dealing with parents/bosses, and being asked to help with extra-curricular stuff. Sometimes he comes home from work absolutely beat. In every aspect of our jobs he is working harder than I am and getting paid less. I think it would be safe to say that he is burned out. 

He has not said this directly to me but I fear he is starting to resent me for how much easier I have it when it comes to our work. Often times he comes home and will let me know that he just needs a bit of quiet alone time to decompress, which I definitely give him. He will make comments like ""must be nice to just wear leggings all day"" or ""do you even work?"" 

Now for clarification, when I began making more money we had a very open conversation about if we wanted to re-allocate how we split our expenses. When we made the same salary it just made sense to go 50/50 on everything. When I started my new job, I proposed moving to a new split that more equitably represented what we were getting paid. He declined. We're comfortable and can afford our needs, while also treating ourselves to nights out and stuff like that occasionally. I do the majority of housework (cooking, cleaning) which was also the case before I worked from home. I have student loans and some credit card debt I am working on paying down, he does not have any debt. 

So, all these factors considered I want to be the best, most supportive partner I can be. I know that he loves many parts of teaching and he hasn't suggested to me that he wants to leave, but I would be supportive if he did. We probably could not survive on my income alone so he needs to keep working in some way. Any tips on how to broach this or support him through his resentment and burnout would be appreciated. 

TLDR: My partner and I used to work similar jobs/make similar money. I moved on to a cushy consulting job that pays more and is fully remote, he is still stuck in the trenches and is very burnt out. We share expenses and I fear he is becoming resentful of me and how much easier I now have it with work. Looking for tips on how to not let this ruin what is otherwise a very happy and healthy relationship. ",,43,38,2025-04-02 19:48:37
relationships,I (29F) need to approach a conversation about not feeling listened to with my bf (28m); we've been long distance for four months of a five month relationship. How can I go about this without sounding like I'm attacking?,"I (29F) have been with my bf (28M) for about five months now, and our relationship has mainly been long distance but he'll be moving to my area in two months, so will no longer be long distance soon.

I find myself losing interest - we talk every night and sometimes I just let him talk while I listen, and sometimes I find myself getting a little resentful that he doesn't ask too much about specific things going on in my life when I'm always asking about his and remember important things to him. I can't tell if my cooling off has to do with the distance (is there such a thing as too much talking?). When we're in person he's really caring and sweet, and I really do like him a lot. But I don't know how to approach a conversation of ""hey, I feel like you're not caring enough about my life and I feel like I'm not being listened to,"" especially over the phone. To me, it sounds like a relationship-ending conversation, and I really don't want it to sound like that, because I really want to give us a fair shot when he moves and we can be together in person.

How can I go about this without sounding like I'm attacking or accusing him? And for those who have been in LDRs, have you ever felt this way, and do you think distance contributed to feeling a little ""cool"" on someone?

relationships,"I (23F) love my boyfriend (24M), but our past still lingers. I don’t know if I can do this forever.","I (23F) love my boyfriend (24M) but our past still lingers. I don't know if I can do this forever.

My boyfriend (24M) and I (23F) have been together for almost four years now. From the very beginning, things weren’t quite right. When we met, I was in a really dark place, and somehow, instead of things getting better, they only got worse.  

I had a previous four-year relationship, so I had expectations of what love should be, but I didn’t know how to express them properly. I didn’t exactly know how to set boundaries. He, on the other hand, had never been in a serious relationship before. He had no real expectations, no understanding of what a healthy partnership should look like. And just a few months in, he lied to me. It was about something significant, and it shattered the little trust we had built. That was when everything started to spiral.  

I fell into a deep depression. I started having severe panic attacks - so intense they looked more like seizures than anything. At the same time, our fights became unbearable. I tried so hard to be a good partner. I was working exhausting night shifts, and while I was at work, he was out with his friends who drank too much, gambled, and lived recklessly. They stopped liking me after we started dating even though I knew them prior to that. And after he had already lied to me once, I couldn’t shake the anxiety.  

For two years, we were caught in a cycle of breaking up and getting back together - always at his decision. Every time, I was left feeling more broken than before. At my lowest, I became suicidal. My panic attacks worsened, the fights never stopped. And when we moved in together, I saw a side of him I had never seen before. He never hit me, but his anger was scary at times. He punched a door, shattered furniture, threw my things across the room. I grew up with a physically abusive father, so being around that kind of rage - watching a man lose control like that in general - made me shut down completely at times. It wasn’t his fault that my past made it even harder for me to cope, but it was exhausting; 

And then there were his friends. They resented me, hated that he was spending more time with me. I did everything I could to be accepted - I cooked their favorite meals, invited them over constantly, encouraged him to maintain his friendships and see them more often. None of it mattered. They still spoke behind my back and he didn't try to protect me. One of them - a girl studying psychology - tried to convince me that I was the problem, that I had an anxious attachment style, that I was suffocating him. But I was never controlling, quite the opposite actually. I never stopped him from seeing them. And yet, no matter what I did, they hated on me anyway.

Eventually, my boyfriend started resenting me too. He told me I had ruined his life, ruined his friendships, ruined him. He said these things while I was in the middle of my worst panic attacks,I could barely breathe and when I was at my most vulnerable. And the way he looked at me in those moments - like I was something pathetic, something he was ashamed of - hurt more than anything else.  

It’s important to say that I’ve never been perfect in this relationship. My panic attacks may have started after something he did, but they weren’t *because* of him. I had already lived a rough life before him and someone who had a more stable upbringing would have reacted differently. I had jealousy issues at times - nothing extreme, and I always kept them to myself - but they still caused tension. I know I wasn't easy to be with. And even though I struggled, I did my best to never make him feel responsible for my mental health.  

So one day, I left and blocked him. I moved to another country just to make sure I wouldn’t go back. I thought that would be the end of it but kept on having nightmares every night about it; 

Then, after a few months, he found a way to reach me. He told me he had started therapy, that he was working on himself and that he had changed. So I gave him another chance.  

And he really did change.  

He became the person I always wished he could be. The anger has stopped. He has learned to communicate. He has been treating me with kindness, with patience. He no longer blames me for his problems. My panic attacks instantly disappeared. For a year, I felt happy.  

But lately, something feels a bit off.  

His friends are still in his life. His brother - who is immature and difficult in his own way - is still there. My boyfriend has distanced himself from his friends, since through therapy, he’s realized they are not a good influence. But they’re still there and are not making things easy for me to this day. And he’s telling me that if I want to be with him, I have to accept them - his brother and his best friend at least. He told me that I have to let the past go. That *he* has moved on, so why can’t I?  Also, we had a few conversations about priorities recently, ones that I hoped would bring us closer. But instead, they’ve drained me and after the last one, something in me just shifted.

I don’t really know what to do anymore.  

I’ve given so much to this relationship. I know that compromise is a big part of being with someone, and I’ve never had a problem with that - but lately, it feels like my limits have been pushed too far.  

These past few days, I’ve been spiraling. I don’t even know why, but I feel disconnected, like I’m dissociating. My patience feels completely drained, my anxiety is through the roof, and I can’t shake the feeling that we’re going to break up soon. It doesn’t even feel real, but the thought keeps getting stronger.  

I’ve tried talking to my boyfriend about it, but I don’t think he really takes me seriously since there isn’t a “big” issue. But maybe that’s the problem. I’m usually pretty self-aware, but right now, I feel lost. Like I’ve finally hit my limit after nearly four years. I feel exhausted, too drained to even explain myself anymore. Numb.  

And the worst part? I feel guilty for feeling this way.

Maybe I just need more time and will find a way to make peace with the things he wants me to. It is possible I’m overthinking everything; But right now, I feel stuck between the love I have for him and the past that still lingers over our relationship and a future with people I don't want in my life. 

Has anyone been through something like this? Do you recognise this feeling and what do you think it means? 

Thank you in advance, I would really appreciate your honesty and I am sorry for the lengthy post! 

TL;DR: My boyfriend (24M) and I (23F) had a toxic relationship for two years—constant fights, his anger issues, and friends who hated me. I developed severe panic attacks and eventually left, blocking him and moving away.  

Months later, he reached out after starting therapy, and he truly changed. We’ve been happy for a year, but now I’m struggling. His friends are still around, and he insists I have to accept them. I also feel like I’m prioritizing our future while he’s more focused on himself.

relationships,I (23M) am having doubts about my GF (20F) and I really just don’t know what to do?,"So I have a feeling people might think I’m an arsehole in this post. But I’m just going to ask for some advice. 

So I’ve been seeing this girl for 5 months now. I asked her to be my girlfriend maybe a month ago. I really do like her. She’s kind, she’s pretty funny, pretty. But I’m just having doubts and it’s nothing really she’s done. 

First off… the biggest sort of worry and potential crack I saw was the fact she’s vegan. I didn’t think it would be too difficult at first but it is. Eating out isn’t an issue. It’s the eating together at home which is such a pain. Like I bought her a product, I think it was like shampoo and she just explained it wasn’t vegan so she can’t use that one and I just feel like I’m stepping on egg shells when discussing discussing mainly food around her. She doesn’t mind me eating meat around her but like i definitely eat non vegan food all the time and I just don’t want to compromise and eat vegan only stuff. 

Secondly… me and her have never had other partners before and doing stuff with each other for the first time. But honestly when I’m around her, like very small stuff but they mean a lot to me, like greeting each other and just other stuff that’s sort of hard to put into words but basically when we’re not sleeping, sitting next to each other we’re still sort of awkward around each other. I dunno it’s so hard to put into words but it still sometimes feels like I’m meeting her for like the second or third time. Like I still feel slightly awkward around her. It doesn’t always feel natural. We are both naturally shy people which maybe plays a part in it but id expect by now to just act with her like how i act with like my best friend or someone like that. 

Thirdly… other than we’re cuddling watching a movie or sleeping together there’s basically no affection. Again i think its to do with not feeling 100% natural around her but in public or just around when im in her room, i never randomly hug her or she doesn’t do the same to me or hold each others hands or just basically show any display of affection other than those times. 

I think ive covered my main points. Now the part which i feel like someone people will find me an arsehole. The thing is I love the affectionate moments we do have. And it’s not like I feel nothing. I want to hold her, I want her to feel safe in my arms. I do feel some way about her when doing intimate things but I’m not quite sure what that feeling is. Like it’s more than friends but less than someone I love or am starting to love. And I don’t want that intimacy to go because I enjoy it with her but also just in general which I know is selfish. 

The things is. A lot of stuff I mine fault and people might say “she likes you so just kiss her in public” but I don’t 100% feel comfortable with that. I want someone I am absolutely infatuated by and just head over heels for. And I don’t know if I feel that way with her

I’ve been married to my husband for a little over a year and overall I’ve been happy but I feel like I’ve been ignoring a lot of things I didn’t realize are going wrong. One of them which is I thought my husband is just a passionate debater but I’m starting to think it’s more than that. He picks the smallest little things to debate/argue over and while I hated it so much I thought maybe debating is a passion of his so I decided to get better at it myself and debate with him over little stuff. It was very frustrating but overtime I became better at noticing and communicating my points , hearing out his, and stopping when I realize a debate is going in circles.

As I see things more clearly I feel like he isn’t a genuine debater, I feel like he debates just to be right or make someone feel stupid so he can feel better. I can’t help but feel that maybe I’ve just been a punching bag because of his negativity. 

It just hit the breaking point today and I have explained the issue before that he puts my opinions down instead of just respecting my opinion and ending the discussion. And when I end it he acts weird like he wants a reaction out of me. It just feels like he wants control when he debates.

Anyway I don’t know if I should even stay and fix this because apparently whenever I bring up a problem there has to be hard concrete evidence for it, he can’t just listen understand my feelings and admit he could do better. This is for a lot of things unless they are super small and easy to fix. Instead he asks for more reasons and says it doesn’t make sense, and tries to counter every reason I have for how I feel or think. It really sucks because his sister was around for one of them and apparently I’m wrong and he’s right. She’s a sweet girl and I don’t think she’s intentionally biased but I feel like she doesn’t understand because she’s not in my position as his partner and he’s better at wording things smartly. Anyways I’m getting so sick of it and I know this problem may seem small or stupid I’m just getting so tired I think of packing my stuff up and leaving I don’t know if I’m okay or if I’m gonna regret it I just really care about him but I’m just so confused on what to do. I’ve had a rough past few years ever since covid and I don’t really have friends (the few close friends I had I have recently cut off for different reasons) or much outside perspective and I just feel really lost. I don’t know I don’t think he listens to my feelings either on purpose because he wants to be right or he’s seriously stupid I don’t know . He doesn’t always fail to hear me out but I always feel like it’s for “easier” or more convenient things that he does. Anything would be helpful to hear thanks guys 

TL;DR: i thought my husband is passionate with debating but i feel like he’s just passionate at winning or making me feel dumb/putting me down. I can never explain the problem or how I feel without him telling me it doesn’t make sense or asking for more evidence. Kind of feels like I’m not listened to/believed for a lot of problems.",,9,67,2025-04-03 01:39:37
relationships,I (26F) feel guilty thinking about breaking up with my (24M) boyfriend,"TLDR; would I be throwing away a long time relationship because I’m not getting physical affection after always being affectionate with my boyfriend 

I’m coming here to seek advice concerning my relationship with my partner of almost 4 years.

My partner is Muslim and quite serious about it and he practices as well as he can.
Although it’s considered bad, we’ve always been affectionate with each other, cuddling, hugging, holding hands, kissing everywhere but the mouth etc.

We’re unfortunately having to convince his family to accept me and let us get married. 
We should be able to see them face to face this summer.

Because of that issue, he prays even more for us to be able to stay together and marry which I appreciate and admire. 

Along with that, he also refrains from any physical affection. 
The only thing he lets go is quickly hugging.
We also used to sleep together everyday and basically live together but he suddenly decided to stop as he felt guilty doing it knowing it’s not permissible in his religion.

He fears his prayers won’t be answered if he keeps doing those acts that are considered sinful.

Although I love him with all my heart and have accepted that we may have to separate in the next months, I’m having a hard time.

I respect him and his religion and will never force him to do anything he isn’t comfortable doing.
But I’m someone that NEEDS physical touch to feel loved, even more when I’m on my period or close to having it. 

I hate it but I’m considering breaking up or pushing him to talk with his family via video call sooner than expected as they aren’t living in the same country.

I don’t know how long I can go without affection and it’s honestly making me feel guilty to feel this way because there’s other ways to feel love.

Would breaking up over this be considered throwing away such a long relationship that could’ve ended in marriage?",,7,6,2025-04-03 02:01:29
relationships,My (34f) husband (31m) is a picky eater and it's affecting our marriage,"My (34f) husband (31m) is a picky eater and it's affecting our marriage. 

My husband is an amazing cook. Everyone loves the food he makes. Unfortunately he holds the same standards for others' cooking and does not enjoy cooking himself every day. So he's constantly disappointed or hungry. It's driving me mad that he won't either eat the food I make or make himself something simple.

We've been together for 9 years and married for 4. Now have a 2 year old child together. Important to mention that we're from different countries, different cultures, different religions and had very different childhoods. Despite this, we share the same goals in life, the same central values and the same attitude to parenting. 

For a few years we were in a long distance relationship, so the food thing was never an issue. Then we lived in my country with my father and took turns cooking meals each night. Also no issues. I guess he wanted to make a good impression on my father and would eat everything either of us made. Now we have moved permanently to his country (his home village) he will only eat food from his culture that has been prepared well. 

Here, it's still common that women cook meals 3 times a day for their family. He knew from the start that I would never be that kind of wife. I have tried learning from his sister the past few years but it never tastes the same and the disappointment on his face makes me no longer want to bother. I could spend hours cooking and he'll eat a tiny bit then make another meal just for himself a few hours later. It feels like a massive waste of time for both of us. 

I'm not a picky eater. I'll eat anything. I do not enjoy cooking but will make sure our child and I have food and keep things fairly simple. We live remote and don't have access to a shop - only markets once a week. I already struggle with not having access to familiar ingredients and figuring out what I can actually prepare. There is only one ""restaurant "" where we can eat and it gets very boring eating the same 2 meals there several times a week. 

He's never explicitly asked me to cook more but he does complain a lot that he's hungry and I just want to hear a solution that he'd be happy with. I've tried asking ""what do you want to eat"" and he won't have an answer. He literally won't eat food from any other culture. All I want is for us to be able to eat dinner together in the evenings. 

Things I've tried:
- cooking food from his culture - disappointment that the flavour isn't right
- cooking food that I'm familiar with - won't eat it or eats only a little and needs something with rice later anyway 
- asking him to cook - which he does maybe 2 or 3 times a week (these days are happy for everyone!)
- paying his sister to cook - he thinks she's too busy to do that for us
- cooking just for myself and letting him go hungry - grumpy hungry husband bringing the vibes down for everyone else

What to do??  

Tl;dr: husband has high standards for food and won't come up with a solution. It's a constant cause of conflict and I've run out of ideas to try.

Edit: At home he does half the house work without being asked. He does the food shopping. He does his own laundry and looks after our child. He's the responsible one in his family who people always turn to for help and reliability. We run a successful family business together. He built half our house and manages 3 hectares of land. So this is why I'm so confused why such a simple task as eating or preparing food when at home is such a problem.",,270,94,2025-04-02 06:07:45
relationships,I (21M)  need help on how to tell my mother that my father is kicking us out,"My parents have been divorced for a long time, since I was 10. I have a deep hate for my father, but I can't avoid him. Either because I was a minor or because that he wants to meet my sister and I need to be there for safety reasons. 

Just earlier when we're on a trip he told me that he's going to sell the house (his name) that my mom and my sister living at. My mom is currently a single mother and had to spend some money for my sister school and college, along with few unsettled debt. My father also gives my mom 50$ for child support monthly. Our country doesn't have much rules on that case so they include the house and 50$ to be enough ig. 

I'm a student who just finished the first year going into second and I only work on weekends but it barely gives me enough money. Idk how to tell my mother about this, she will 100% freak out and there's going to be a huge issues between our family member as well. She had a psychosis before going all rogue with an axe chasing my sister and me when we were kids due to the problem she had. I'm numb, idk how to tell her or should I just keep it as a secret until she receives a letter to move? I'm holding my tears in as I typed this, idk what else I can do to help other than ~~claiming my own life insurance for my family~~

TL;DR How do I tell to my mom that my father is selling the house that they're living in? (We have financial issues)",,1,3,2025-04-03 12:00:06
relationships,I (39F) caught my husband (42M) on multiple hookup/dating sites which has led me into a downward spiral.,"At the beginning of the year I had logged into my husband’s computer to fill out some paperwork that needed to be printed. I noticed that one of his open tabs was a map of a random apartment complex address. Immediately I felt something wasn’t right so out of curiosity I looked at the history on his computer. My gut was right.

I found that he had created multiple profiles on hookup websites starting as early as November of last year, and when I say multiple I’m talking about 15 sites maybe more. I noticed on the majority of the websites he was the one to initiate the conversation by sending explicit pics to random women asking how they felt about casual hookups and wanting to talk dirty to them.

Later on that day when he got home from work I confronted him about it. He said he wasn’t serious about any of it and had created them due to having a mental breakdown, which he showed no signs of having one at any point. He swore up and down that was all of it. Well about a week after I confronted him that gut feeling of knowing something is off still hadn’t gone away so I asked to see his phone. I was right again! He has multiple dating apps on his phone some of which were installed back in February 2024. There were also lengthy conversations on telegram that showed him asking how much he’d have to pay a prostitute for a BJ.

At this point I had gone into a downward spiral and began to experience symptoms of PTSD. By the time I somewhat snapped out of it he had deleted all of his history on his phone and computer along with all the apps and websites. This to me tells me that he’s hiding more but every time I ask him about it he says there is nothing more he’s hiding. I may not be the smartest person in the world but I do know that when somebody deletes all of their history that usually means there’s more that he doesn’t want me to find out about.

How do I get him to open up about the honest truth? I am not the type of wife who will constantly nag him about it until it eventually comes out.

I stupidly still love him and don’t want to end our 12 years of marriage but I don’t know how to trust him ever again or rid the extreme PTSD that I still have from all of this.

**TL;DR;**: How did you cope with the trust issues and PTSD caused from your partner’s infidelity?",,52,41,2025-04-02 14:14:24
relationships,My ex has moved in and wants to try a relationship with me again.,"

My ex (47M) and I (32F) have 2 children together ages 13 and 9. 

He and I have a very good co-parenting relationship. He has never done me or our kids wrong. He has been at every school function, every conference, every game or recital or practice. He is very involved with their lives and is a fantastic father. If I have ever needed anything he would have it to me as quickly as he could. 

Recently he and his gf of 2 years split. It was very messy there is context in my previous post if necessary. When they split he was going to get a hotel but I told him to just move into my spare room. I didn't want my kids to miss out on time with their dad and he and I get along well. 

It has been about a month since then. He is still staying with us and honestly it has been really nice. The kids are ecstatic to have their dad living with us. It has been really nice to have a man in the house and he's been pretty happy to do random projects around the house with the kids helping. I think this arrangement is working out pretty good so far. 

The thing is he has asked me to go out to dinner with him a couple of times and that was nice. We mostly just talked about what's going on and the kids and stuff. Not much about our personal relationship. 

Last week he started buying me flowers again. He used to buy me flowers every Tuesday for our table when we were together. He still remembers my favorite foods and all of my food orders at restaurants. He keeps doing small gestures that I think are sweet and honestly I'm super surprised he even remembered. Then he started trying to talk about what went wrong with our relationship and he wants to go to couples therapy and see if we can try again. ( There was never any type of cheating or anything entirely damning that is impossible to come back from we just grew apart).

This is where it gets complicated. I'm sure you've figured out our age gap by now. He and I should have never happened like we did. I would never change it because I wouldn't give up my kids but I was so young. I had some really wrong ideas about life in general and at the time I liked the idea of an older guy wanting me. Now it grosses me out. I'm in my 30s now and the idea of being with a teenager at my age is absolutely disgusting to me. I do not agree with that at all. So I have some internal issues with that specific detail of our relationship. We were also not anywhere near being in the same stages of our lives. I was just figuring out how to adult and he was technically my boss. My parents were absolutely furious about it. They didn't know that I was seeing him until I was already pregnant. I was living in an apartment with a friend while being in college so I did pretty good at hiding my personal life up until that point. Plus my parents were kind of racist so that didn't help at all. They love their grandkids but it took them ( especially my dad) a while to come to terms with it.

With my ex living with me again things are changing and old feelings are being brought up. I honestly missed the way we were together and it feels nostalgic and just all around nice but I also have a lot of negative feelings about a relationship with him again as well. He is still just as sexy as he was honestly he doesn't look much different at all so physically I suppose I'm still attracted to him but idk. 

Plus idk about starting a relationship and then if something happens it could potentially ruin the co-parenting relationship we already have and I don't want my kids to get hurt in the process. 

I have agreed to the therapy appointment but I wanted some outside perspective. 

Edit- we broke up because I was dealing with some depression issues. Our youngest was almost a year old and we are pretty sure I had severe PPD and it wasn't addressed properly. He was very upset when I left. 

Tdlr- my ex had a messy breakup and ended up moving in with me so it wouldn't interfere with his time with our kids. Now he is wanting to do couples therapy and try again on our relationship and I am unsure because if it goes south I don't want to ruin the co-parenting relationship we already have and I dont want my kids to be hurt.

relationships,"I 30M and my gf 27F have trust issues. Well, I do.. can I even move forward or is a lost cause?","I 30M and my gf 27F have been dating for around 8 months (talkings for a little over a year). She is absolutely wonderful. She is kind, gets along with my friends, is intelligent etc… I truly am head over heels for her. However, there is a problem I can’t seem to shake.

When we first started talking(over Facebook dating). We talked for a short while and planned a date to meet. When that day came around I heard nothing from her. I texted her little before the date and asked if she was still interested. She said she made other plans. This hurt but I moved on. I stopped talking to her altogether after that cause I figured she wasn’t interested. A month later I decided to hit her up again. She agreed to go out on a date that of which we did go on. We had a great time! Ended up talking till 2 in the morning in her car about anything and everything. The next day I asked her out on a second date. She told me any day but Friday cause she needed some “her” time. I agreed and we made plans for Sunday. We hung out and that’s when we really started hitting it off.
But this is where things also took a turn..
I asked her how her Friday “her” day was and she brushed it off and just said “it was fine”
Come to find out she went out with a guy and ended up doing things with him in his car.
That hurt allot when I found out.
But it doesn’t just end there. I found out that the first time we were going to go out she ditched me for some other guy. This guy and her had sex and she ended up getting an STD scare. She was being tested for this while her and I started becoming sexually active. However, she lied to me and said she got tested and was all good. Turns out she did have something(although treatable) and I had to take antibiotics or whatever for it. 
Point is, this could’ve absolutely ruined my life. Lying about something like that is just crazy to me. The only reason I found out is because I pressed her about it and made her show me papers which she did not have.

Fast forward almost a year later all these worries still haunt our relationship. My confidence has been dwindling. Problems and insecurities that I’ve never had in a relationship are present and just keep coming back up. We are currently fighting right now because I just can’t seem to get over it.. I fear I can never trust her. Which means we can’t be together right? I know the simple answer is “either get over it or move on” but, is there something I can do that could help. I just don’t know and I’m tired of jeopardizing what could be an amazing thing. 

TL;DR We had a rocky start and it affects us a year later. Can you get over things that ruined your trust in the beginning? If so how did you do it? ",,4,9,2025-04-03 03:02:12
relationships,I 24M need help navigating this relationship with my GF 22F,"

Im at a point where im super confused. Story:

Ive been with my GF for 10 months now. We met in Crete in a program my country has . We hit it off instantly we had an amazing month there and got together at the end.

Then we came back to our country. Thats when I started to notice something is not right. She was overly sensitive and often overreacted. The day after we got back we met up, went to my brother’s apartment and watched memes. I escorted her to her train after and went home myself. She wanted to brake up with me because it wasn’t working etc.

We obviously didnt break up. But that started a clear pattern in our relationship. She started looking through my phone ( instagram search , messages , pictures , archived pictures everything) .In these 10 months we broke up 4-5 times. One time the breakup was initiated from my side as her constant belittling ( she called me disgusting, worthless etc) didnt stop even though I talked to her about it a million times. We got together again after 2-3 days and she promised she would stop and to her credit , she did. 

Making me choose over family and her: 
There were instances where I was put in situations where I had to choose between family and her and when I chose family. I cant post a link here but basically it was my mothers and brothers birthday. We told her the car and I are needed to drive everyone all day( party was in a venue) she still asked me to pick her up 100km away. I told her i couldnt and then she called me all sorts of names like worthless not even a man, mamas boy, “ why am i even with you” im an idiot  etc etc .You can see the post on my page. she threw a fit and called me all sorts of things , belittling me for sticking by the plan we explained 3-4 times to her before it even happened. 

I forgave her a lot of things but tried sticking to my boundaries as best as possible. That also often led to arguments like 2 weeks ago, where I spent tuesday and wednesday at her place . I told her thursday night that i would be drinking and bonding with family on our balcony. She initially said its a good idea. On thursday night she asked whether we are going to call or not. I told her no, with the reasoning that i spent the last 2 days with her and plan to spend Friday till Monday with her also, stating I want to spend tonight with family. She interpreted that as me rejecting her alltogether. She claimed if I im feeling forced to go to her place then i shouldnt go, in fact i should never go because im just a waste of time, im a nobody in her life, im just a guy she just has fun with and that im not welcome in her home anymore. She said more things but I don’t think its necessary to include it here . We broke up that weekend. (Initiated by her) . 

I decided to stay my ground and leave the relationship for good. She called me everyday like 20 times, texted my relatives etc and on the last day she showed up to my place to talk. We talked. She understood where my concerns and problems are coming from. She now says she will start therapy and focus on my wellbeing . Since my family have an extrem dislike to her she said she is ready to come down, face their judgement and change for the better . She said she would stop or at least try and better herself as much as she could and she doesn’t care about the scrutiny she would get from my family as she sees that they are right. She just wants to be better for me so she doesn’t lose me. She also told me when we try again we should write our boundaries and no gos on a piece of paper and start on a strong foundation. 

I find her proposition really flattering, i don’t know how many women would go to such lengths to try again. 

I know if we decide to try one last time I will lose a lot of credibility from my family, as they all think if we get together again we are idiots and they say she pulls me down mentally.


Would you try it again with her?


Edit1 : she would also bring up my exes a lot. Makes me block them even though they were more than 3 years ago. She would bring them up even in normal conversation asking like “ did you do this with xyz”?


Tldr: gf is very emotional and can become very mean with her words. She is promising change and to her credit she always pulled through with it. ",,0,5,2025-04-03 09:55:40
relationships,What is the Best Way to Talk With My(F30) Room Mate(22F) Asking Them To Stop Smoking In The Apartments?,"# What is the Best Way to Talk With My Room Mates Asking Them To Stop Smoking In The Apartments?

We have known one another for a year sharing the apartment.

Recently my (30f) household has been smelling like tobacco. This bothers me because it's bad for my health and the health of those who live here. I didn't agree to be impacted this way by living here. This is stressful for me as someone who tries to be healthy and doesn't smoke. Since the smell/residue could get on me and my things. It could become difficult to remove. I already smell it in my own room. The smell could potentially affect my belongings. I'd need to get new ones when I move. I can no longer invite people to our apartment when they have asthma, knowing my roommate is smoking indoors.

The only roommate I know who smokes is 22F Marie.There are two others who I would not assume don't smoke. I'd talk to both of them as well to be fair to all. I don't want to assume it is any one specific person until I talk to everyone. I have asked a couple of people I know to stop by at my apartment to verify the smell, because I don't want to assume that it is tobacco without a few people confirming it. Though I know the property management would know right away, and would not have any tolerance for it.

Before I moved in and signed a lease, I established that I wanted to live in an apartment where people didn't smoke inside it. My lease agreement also has sections specifically saying it's a non-smoking apartment and various consequences of the condition of smoking in it, because smoking can leave residual impacts on the apartment. I don't want to face the potential consequences from property management, and I know it would be rude to have any of my room mates removed on this basis.

What is the best way to talk to my room mate about this in a way that is polite and productive? I need to make sure that the outcome is that the smoking stops.

TL;DR One of my roommates is smoking tobacco in the apartment, what is the best way to bring this up Kindly/Politely and get a resolution that means smoking no longer happens inside?",,2,5,2025-04-03 06:02:21
relationships,I (26F) am not my bf (22M) ideal body type. How can I trust him?,"Should I trust him? 
I’m a 26 y/o virgin and live a sheltered or conservative life. I have never been in a relationship before this one. I met my bf on instagram. I fell for his personality which he portrayed as career driven and stable (not distracted by clubs, drinking and women). We entered into a long distance relationship and it has been less than 1 year now. 

We recently got into an argument and he told me he was cutting contact. He has never done this before and it was abrupt. I checked his social media the next day. He had followed 3 girls and a celebrity. I saw his like under the celebrity's butt picture. And she has the complete opposite body type, face and skin colour to me. 

My head became warm after this because I never perceived him to be this type of person. Especially because I thought he preferred modesty and that was partly why I thought he was attracted to me. Also, I thought I had found someone with a similar mindset. 

I did confront him about it and he was apologetic after I started crying. Admitted that he always struggled with lust and only changed after dating me. He told me about his attraction to butts which made me uncomfortable. Also admitted that he used to like pictures of butts on instagram before dating me. He confirmed he was not and is not a saint but wants to change and be a better person for me. 

1) I feel sad because I don’t have a butt; I’m flat back there. This makes me insecure because he is very attracted to them.  
2) He was faking his personality this whole time! I’m unsure if I should trust him again. 
3) He did do sweet gestures for me in the past but I genuinely question my self worth now. Every time I see him, I am reminded of the pictures of women he has liked. And now I feel like I'm seeing the world through his lens. When I see a woman he might like based on physical appearance, I internalize it. 

He wants to know if I want to continue this relationship. Please help me, I have no one to talk to about this and really need advice.

**TL;DR; : My boyfriend seems to have consumed porn of women with big butts before our relationship. After we had a fight I saw he liked a plump butt picture of a celebrity. When I confronted he admitted that he lied to me about his personality. He struggles with lust and only tried to change after dating me. He said he will try his best to fight this battle because he loves me. Should I trust him? I'm have a flat butt and I feel really insecure after hearing his admisssion**.

relationships,Plz help!! I (16f) am confused with why my long distance bf (16m) is acting different and talking to me less,"We have been together for 2 months and he would call me every single day. we would sleep on call together and he would always say the nicest things to me that nobody has ever said to me before. he made me feel loved all the time but these past few weeks he’s been distant for some reason and he stopped calling me. I was scared that he was gonna start ghosting me because I’ve been through this before and it hurts. Ever since the last time he called me our conversations have been slowing down and we were texting but everyday he would tell me that he would call me but he never ended up doing that. Eventually he didn’t talk to me for a day or two and I thought it was odd because he would give me a reason to why he’s not responding. I didn’t want him to start ghosting me because I’ve never loved anyone this much in my whole life and he’s so special to me. So I wrote a long message and I asked him if he wants to break up with me and I told him that I didn’t wanna jump to conclusions because he could’ve been busy and I told him how I felt like he wasn’t interested in me anymore. I told him that if he wants to break up with me then it’s okay and I just didn’t wanna get my feelings hurt from him not responding and that I’ve already been going through a lot. He said he was planning on calling me but he fell asleep and he said he knows he owes me an explanation but things have been weird and it has nothing to do with our relationship and he’s sorry for letting it affect me (I thought he would give me more information later but he didn’t and I’m just confused on what’s going on). I told him that I was just making sure that he still loved me and he said that he can reply faster. He said that he should be calling me and talking to me because I’ve been good to him. He told me that he was gonna call me that night and ended up not doing it again and the next day he said that he’s sorry and that his sleep schedule was messed up. (A lot of this happened last week). I would still tell him that I loved him and that I missed him a lot but he wouldn’t really say it back. He didn’t reply to me for two days so I asked him if everything is okay and he responded with him saying that it’s nothing about me and he just needs to think and he said that he knows hes being selfish but he doesn’t know what else to tell me and he doesn’t know anymore and he’s been really confused and he said that he’s being a dickhead for not texting me and he doesn’t know what to say right now (these have happened this week).

I honestly didn’t know how to respond to him so I left him on read for 3 days and this whole situation has been stressing me out and I have really bad anxiety and I feel like I need to respond soon because I’m so scared that he’s gonna abandon me and I don’t want him to suddenly leave. I feel like he’s slowly forgetting about me and I know that whatever is going on could be personal but he keeps giving me these half assed explanations that make no sense and we’ve had so many deep conversations so I don’t see why he can’t just tell me what’s going on. I don’t think he’s cheating on me because he told me that he’s too awkward to talk to girls but at the same time I do feel like he’s cheating but I don’t wanna think about it because it hurts. I wanna know what’s really going on but I’m too scared to ask because I feel like I’ve been bothering him this whole time and I don’t wanna be nosy. I just don’t know what to do anymore and I don’t wanna break up with him because I feel like he’s all I have left.

TL;DR: my bf is being distant and he told me that it has nothing to do with our relationship but he’s giving me vague explanations on why he’s acting this way and I’m confused on what to do.

Plz help me idk what to do and I would rlly appreciate it😭

relationships,I CANNOT leave,"My bf (21) and I (F21) have been going out for two years now as of this week. I have always been in long term relationships since 14 and he has never had a committed relationship prior to this. I would go from relationship to relationship and have never been single for longer than maybe 7-8 months (and that was whilst having a situationship (my first ever)). I met my current bf and for the first couple of months everything was fine and then (duh) we started to have problems. I have always had issues with trust and he has clear issues with mental health, he never used to really speak about it though apart from some comments here and there about bipolar.

The second six months maybe of our relationship was absolute hell for me, he would argue and critique me for anything and everything and because i was SO scared to lose him I would go along with it and end up apologising for absolutely fucking nothing. He stole my confidence and i lost friends etc and i mean what else would you expect. Then something happened in September and i ended it. However, this didn’t last long at all I was in such a terrible place and i think that worked in his favour. I was really badly assaulted by a stranger and had really quite bad medical issues and wound up in hospital a few times, it was to do with my heart so naturally i was absolutely terrified. So we got back/stayed together and he was the absolute best version of himself and did absolutely everything for me. However i was hurt by what had happened so i hurt him back (call me just as bad as him it’s true in that sense but not in the sense of all the emotional torment he put me through, ik there’s two sides of every story and maybe I should’ve left then but I didn’t I just can’t do it). 


Obviously all the consequences of that followed and again we stayed together, YES I KNOW HOW TOXIC THIS IS IM SORRY. It’s just so strange because i grew back my spine and have matured even slightly in those couple of months and have realised that okay i don’t think our relationship will ever be the same even though he treats me right now. and that’s what makes it so hard because he does and i love him and he clearly is in a difficult mental state, he tells me he couldn’t cope without me and wants to marry me etc. every single day. He has even taken a job he doesn’t want to do for three years, so he can stay where I am at university. But i just know it’s not right even though i truly love him so much. 


The thing is i just physically cannot bring myself to end it, i have never been able to do that unless i become physically repulsed by that man. I don’t feel strong enough and admittedly im scared of being alone. And largely because he isolated me so much I don’t have any real female friendships which I miss so much so i don’t feel that supported. I don’t know how to bring myself to do it because one minute i think about how i do want to spend the rest of my life with him and another how much i hate him. My mental health has been shot to shit and i genuinely don’t know if that’s because of our relationship or the culmination of so many things. What do i do, I don’t know whether im making a mistake if i do? And okay it’s completely fair to be harsh and say ‘just grow a fucking spine and leave’ but I’m not asking for that I’m asking for genuine advice, I need to leave (i think) I just don’t know how to do that. 

TLDR; Been in relationships since 14, currently in 2y relationship where something happened and i ended up staying/getting back bc of external factors. Changed behaviour but never going to be the same. I need to end it but still love him and have heard all tough love before, i just cannot bring myself to do it. No idea why. Just need actual advice.

relationships,Bf made fun of my physical appearance,"
I’m (31F) been with my bf (30M) for 8 months, he have srew up many time already and every time he either say he’s joking or it’s a mistake and will never do it again, but last week we had a fight and after we made up when we were happily walking home he out of no where told me your butt look like a square (because i have hip dips) and when i said that’s upsets me he said he’s joking but i can tell he was not joking but in a way he have unresolved feelings with me and I can’t help but feel sad and angry because i never had this insecurity about my body but i also don’t like my hip dips and recently i noticed that i feel conscious about my appearance and it really makes me angry
 I want to know what’s the right move here?

TL;DR: Bf often dismisses hurtful comments as “jokes.” Recently, he made fun of my hip dips, making me self-conscious about something I wasn’t insecure about before. I feel sad and angry—what should i do ?",,22,21,2025-04-02 15:31:25
relationships,I (18F) think I hate my boyfriend (17M),"As it says in the title of this I think I hate my boyfriend. we have been together for 2 months and he lovebombed me right away but me being stupid fell for it and now he’s completely attracted and I feel like I can’t break things off. 

Everything he does annoys the crap out of me. Whenever he touches me It’s like I cringe from it. I’ve met his whole family and he bought my prom ticket. He also lost all of his friends because of me and all he says about the situation is “I’d rather have you then them” which makes me feel even worse that I’ve been feeling like this. I don’t even want to text him let alone see him. He’s coming over in an hour and I really don’t want to see him. What do I do? 

TL;DR: I think I hate my bf but I feel like I can’t break up with him. What do I do?",,0,42,2025-04-03 17:18:47
relationships,In Laws! Am I Overthinking Boundaries with My (27F) Boyfriend’s (27M) Family? Red Flags or Just Me?,"I (27F) am in a relationship (3 months) with my boyfriend (27M), and I’ve been noticing some things lately that have me worried about boundary issues between him and his family. I used to love how much he cared for them – it was a huge green flag for me at first. But now, some of his actions are starting to feel like there might be too much responsibility placed on him. I’m not sure how to approach. How do I approach this without overstepping since we have only been together 3 months?

Here’s how things have progressed:

* On our first date, he mentioned that he had already told his mom about me and even took a photo of us to show her. At first, it seemed sweet, but now it feels a little too much too soon.
* Shortly after we started dating, his sister moved out of state for a new job and needed help with her property and moving. My boyfriend took care of a lot of the details – finding tenants for her place, handling most of the move, and even interviewing dog sitters for her. It seemed like a lot, but I tried not to read too much into it at first.
* He’s told me multiple times that his parents are bad at managing money, which motivates him to be financially responsible. However, he’s also shared that he’s given them large sums of money in the past – like $30,000 – and said he’d give them his last $10,000 if they needed it. This is where I get uneasy, especially since his parents drive a Tesla and travel a lot. It seems more like he is funding a lifestyle than saving a need.
* Recently, when I met his parents, his mom mentioned that his sister had spent the security deposit for her tenants. She wants to work bottle service to make up for it, but my boyfriend wants to give her $5,000 to prevent her from doing that. I find this manipulative, especially since his sister is capable of finding another job and spends money irresponsibly. It feels like his family is expecting him to fix everything for them. The mom also made this comment towards the end of this conversation that made me uncomfortable, ""You know when your dad and I are gone you are going to have to watch out for her.""
* Last weekend, his parents got into a big screaming fight and his mom called him in the middle of it for his help? I thought this was odd.
* While we were at his parents home recently, he pointed out a property across the street, mentioning that his mom wanted them to buy it to keep the money from being spent recklessly. The whole vibe was very much not frugal.

How do I approach this without overstepping since we have only been together 3 months?

Thanks!

TLDR: I (27F) am dating my boyfriend (27M), and while I initially admired his close relationship with his family, I'm starting to feel like there's too much responsibility placed on him. He helps his sister a lot, has given his parents large sums of money despite them being financially well-off, and is constantly expected to fix family issues. How do I approach this without overstepping since we have only been together 3 months?",,5,11,2025-04-02 20:47:14
relationships,"My girlfriend(23F) told me(22M) her family was in a serious accident, but when I checked, none of it seemed real. How do I talk to her about this?","I (22M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (23F) for 3 years and 8 months. For most of that time, we’ve had a strong and healthy relationship. We've supported each other, communicated well, and spent a lot of time together. Recently, I started a new job, so I’ve been a bit busier, but we still make time to meet every day, talk on video calls, and stay close.

Earlier in our relationship, she told me she had a heart condition related to her vagus nerve. It never really affected our day-to-day lives, but I’ve always tried to be understanding and supportive whenever it came up. About a month ago, she mentioned feeling unwell—she said her heart was racing—but afterward she seemed fine, and life went on.

Things started to shift about a week ago when she told me—and some of our mutual friends—that both her father and grandfather had been in a serious road accident. According to her, they live in a mountainous rural area and had to be taken to a hospital four hours away. She said one ambulance got stuck in a landslide. Her father was reported to have developed blood clots, and her grandfather was in critical condition, eventually transferred to the largest hospital in our state.

Throughout all of this, she stayed at our shared flat (I live with a friend), saying she was managing everything through phone calls. Then she told us that her grandfather had flatlined at the hospital but was revived. Later, she said her father was being moved to the same hospital in critical condition.

The next night, she claimed her father’s ambulance had been in another accident and had to be redirected back to the regional hospital. This is when I started noticing inconsistencies. She was telling us she had been in constant contact with her family—her mother, brother, and doctors—but when I saw a missed call from her flatmate and briefly checked her call log, there were no signs of her calling or receiving calls from them. This confused me, because I had heard her supposedly talking to them in the room.

I didn’t want to jump to conclusions or accuse her of anything, so my friend and I decided to call her family directly—out of concern, more than anything else. Her father answered and sounded completely normal. He said no one had been in any accident or hospitalized. We also called her brother, and he confirmed the same.

But even after this, the following day she told us her father had flatlined and was revived after 20 minutes.

I’m at a complete loss right now. I care deeply about her, and I want to believe there’s an explanation. At the same time, I’m feeling confused, hurt, and unsure of how to process everything I’ve been told. I also worry this could be a sign of something deeper going on emotionally or mentally.

My question is: how do I bring this up with her in a way that’s honest but gentle? I don’t want to accuse or corner her, but I do need to talk about what I’ve learned and how I’m feeling. Has anyone been in a similar situation or has advice for how to approach this with care?

TL;DR:
My girlfriend (3 years & 8 months together) recently told me her father and grandfather were in a serious accident involving ambulance delays, landslides, and even flatlining—but when I called her family directly, they said nothing happened. She’s continued adding details to the story even after that. I’m really confused and hurt, but I don’t want to confront her harshly. How can I approach this conversation gently and get clarity without making her feel attacked?",,3,26,2025-04-02 21:46:35
relationships,My girlfriend said she’d rather save her 80 year old mom’s life  than mine,"Hey guys, it’s my first post here. I (20 M)had an heated conversation with my girlfriend (19F), where she said that she’d save her mother’s life over everything. 

We have some discussions about future, cultures and pretty much everything when we “zone out” and begin talking so much. We have a “long distance relationship” cause her family (Muslim) doesn’t approve our relationship and we are planning to move and live togheter the next year. We’ve been togheter for 2 years, and her family is literal HELL (you can guess why is that.)

We had a conversation about an hour ago, where she said that if she had the choice, she’d save her mom over anyone or anything. Mind you, her mom’s boutta hit 70 years old. 
I even put on the plate my life, in the eventual future when we’re married and have a child at 30 (we are our firsts everything and I’m planning to live my whole life with her, but I’m not gonna make this post about how much i love her.), in this case her mom would be 80 years old.

Now, I don’t know what to do. I’m “fragile”, i need constant reassurance and I’m negative pretty much most of the time. This hurt me, really really bad. Hearing that coming from her,(she’d even choose her mother’s life over a baby, i really don’t wanna know if that includes a potential daughter or son of ours). 

Before anyone says anything, i know this is strictly hypothetical, but she made sure to make me know that she was dead serious, and even tho I know this might NEVER happen, and maybe I’m looking too much into this, i don’t know that to do. I’ve given everything for this girl. I’ve been doing my best for her since day one, i even work more shifts during the week to see her 1 time a week (2 hours) cause I drop off work early and can visit her at uni. (Not going into more details.)
Meanwhile her family treats her like complete shit, and I’m almost convinced she might suffer from Stockholm syndrome.

Listen, i love my mom. With my whole heart.  Everything I have, i had, my career and my future, i owe it to her. But she would be the first person to kill me if i ever made a choice like that. 

So i wanna ask anyone who might have had the time and if you did read all of this, thank you so much, am i insane for thinking this isn’t right?

Ps. Don’t ask anything about her family, our situation or anything that doesn’t concern this argument. I know this whole situation is messed up, but this made me start to rethink my whole life I had planned.

Thank you again, whoever will read this.

TLDR; My girlfriend said she would save her 80 year old mother’s life over mine even when we would eventually have a children and I don’t know that to do with that take.",,0,45,2025-04-03 20:37:53
relationships,Should I continue to engage in this relationship of 2 years?,"I (17F) have been in a unconventional relationship with my friend (18M) for a while now. We've known eachother since we were little but only back in 2023 was when we started talking again. From the start our first meeting ended with him trying to do the do with me and I declined. I developed feelings for him soon after since I was still new to guys and relationships at the time. Months later I got over it defining him as a one of those guys who go around with girls and was just tryna make a pass at me. 

Fast forward early 2024 we meet again at my sweet 16 and he compliments me and we're catching up and I say he should spend the night sometime. He ends up doing so like a week later and we're being close and touchy like we were a year ago but end up going a little further this time. Not entirely sex but not short of it either. 

Nov 2024 he stays the night but this time I ask him why he keeps doing this with me and he tells me that he likes me and that if we continue we may even end up dating and goes on and on saying these nice things abt me and what he's like in a relationship which makes me feel super good. It was really sudden and out of the blue though so I'm telling myself don't get too happy, nothing's probably going to come from this. I tell him that we should take it slow and he agrees so I go on with my life texting him a bit here and there. 

Before the end of the year I get to ask him where he's at with this whole thing and he tells me he's 75% on board with dating and 25% scared and unsure. During the last few weeks of the year I decided to tell him that let's try things out when I get back in the country bc I went overseas for winter break and tell him to take this time to get his head straight. 

Fast forward to this year, Jan-Feb-Mar, things go like this. He tells me he doesn't want to have a relationship rn bc he wants to focus on graduating and school things. He apologizes for leading me on and I forgive him and stop talking to him for a few weeks. I talk to him a bit and we call when we play fortnite but no hangouts since Nov. 

Then in February I invite him and his cousin to my school's black history month event and we chat and catch up. That's when I hear from his cousin that he's going on a date that Saturday and I go !? So I immediately ask him abt it and he tells me he defines dates as hangouts kinda and that he genuinely did consider having a relationship with me and reassures that he wasn't lying. He offers staying over so we could talk more abt it and I'm like yea. He spends the night, no freaky stuff happens this time but we get to talk a lot about how he sees this whole relationship thing. 

A lot of heartfelt words get passed between us and even though he's saying he doesn't want a relationship and still goes on ""dates"" with girls I can't shake the feeling that maybe this may blossom into something more than it is. The big reason for this is that I told him that I have a soft spot in my heart for him and that I just can't get angry at you and he told me it was the same for him. He also told me the way he jokes around with me and hangs with me is very different from his friends and that I'm the only one he does these things with. All these romantic things he says and I'm trying super hard to not take them to heart because I've been lied to before and ik that some guys can be really crafty to try and get in ur pants. The thing is that he doesn't wanna go that far with me. He told me if we were to cross that line then we'd have to date. That tells me he has some decency and isn't just messing around with girls. I just don't know.

Right now I'm just stuck trying to define if I've been getting played this whole time or maybe he meant what he said and that I just need to play the waiting game. It's been really hard for me lately because my birthday passed a couple days ago and he was there but I felt like the vibe was off. I have bad anxiety and have a habit of overthinking things so my judgement isn't clear and I need help figuring out if he's a bad guy and I should steer away from him or if he's been telling the truth. 

---

**TL;DR** : Basically there's a chance that me and my friend might end up dating in the future but I don't know if I should wait and see where things go or if I should move on with my life and not continue this. I don't want to wait on him and reject future dating opportunities but I also do want to be in a serious relationship with him if possible. I'm just not sure if this is something worth putting my energy towards since there's no guarantee that he'll still have feelings for me in the future. I'm very unsure on what to think and my anxiety and overthinking makes it hard to rationalize this situation.

relationships,my bf keeps making jokes and it's breaking us apart,"tw.  ed 
I should start with some back story, me (19f) and bf (19m) have been together for a year, and it's great. we've had a lot of downs but we've been working and growing as individuals together. before I met him, I had an Ed for about 4 years to the point where I almost died, I only started to get over it and eat happily the year I met him and he helped a lot. I am still quite skinny, but I'm a lot healthier than I was so that counts for something.
I am quite a sensitive person, we've had conversations about it so I'm trying not to take things so seriously. My partner has started calling me fat, big, chunky, chubbo, fatty, big back as a ""joke"". it was kinda funny at first, threw some back at him, but after many many many times of telling him to stop, he won't. he changed my name on snapchat to ""chubbles"" and he thinks it's absolutely hilarious. I do not think it's hilarious, not anymore, it doesn't make me feel good and tbh I've been losing my appetite a lot more. my Ed symptoms are coming back. I used to cry to him thinking I was fat but he was comfort me and tell me otherwise, now I feel like I'm getting insulted right to my face and I have to just take it. 
I'm trying to show him that it makes me feel genuinely bad when he calls me fat, and it makes me sad that he doesn't respect my no. so I started to not acknowledge it. look to the side whenever he calls me fat. he'll call me big whenever I start eating, so I push the food away and then he encourages me to eat, but then calls me big again when I start to eat again. it makes me want to cry and yell but I'm trying to not be sensitive, I don't want to be sensitive anymore. I don't wanna leave because he's so good, this is a new thing and.. Idk I just want some tips ig
I know I'm not fat, or overweight whatsoever. my ribcage still pokes out of my skin and I'm trying to gain weight and this doesn't help

edit:  okay I can see he's abusive, how do I break up with him

relationships,Clingy friend (25F) is expecting me (25M) to be her 24/7 therapist,"Ok guys so I am an introverted 25 year old guy. I only socialise in small bursts and generally prefer my own company. But recently and old friend who I have kept contact with has latched onto me and clinging hard. She has no other friends any more and has no real hobbies. She is not someone who is ok being alone. And she is going through an awful lot with some pretty bad stuff. Which is why this is really hard because I feel terrible. But work (we both work the same hours) is the only reprieve I get. The rest of the time she is at my place whether I like it or not. Just turns up without a word. And unloads all her stuff on me. She one hundred percent expects me to be emotionally available for her 24/7. If I dare mention that I need alone time to recharge then their are tears, no one cares about me ect. Any suggestions I make for activities she might try are immediately shot down. But the worst thing is my family I know will side with her if I try to enforce boundaries. My mum loves her and has made it perfectly clear she expects me to be there for her as long as she needs. I really don't want to lose my family, but I am pretty that's what will happen if I try to get the alone time I desperately need. This has been going on for months now.

TL;DR- I am an introverted guy. Clingy female friend with a ton of bad stuff going on is treating me like her personal therapist and my family expect me to be just that for her. If I try to force boundaries, I fear I will lose my family. Length of relationship- have known this girl since primary school and been friends for 20 years.",,12,11,2025-04-02 11:52:18
relationships,"My girlfriend (F27) seems to be addicted to Instagram, what do I (M30) do?","It seems that my girlfriend (F27) is addicted to social media, particularly Instagram so much so it's becoming a problem in our relationship. What do I (M30) do about this?

Conversations revolve around Instagram. Such as who is following her, who is following me, why do people follow her, if I should tag her in a story or not. To be honest, this is all rather boring to me. I have been with this girl now for 6 months and it seems that it is getting worse and more frequent.

I do have an Instagram and use it as a form of communication with friends and her, and I've posted pictures of myself on there, but not regularly (maybe once every 6 months) but I find talking about the actual platform very boring.

Today the day consisted of her not liking that some girl that follows me (who I have known for years) and the fact that someone is following her that she doesn't know but is connected to someone she knows. I just find that generally I don't have much to add to these conversations and sometimes I get a bit short with her with sarcasm, which isn't the best but I have a limit.

I have told her that Instagram isn't real and although it's a nice social media to connect with people you know, it isn't life.

At the beginning of the year I ended up back in hospital and was discharged early in March so I’ve been home for a little under a month but ever since I’ve been back we haven’t had sex.  I’ve tried talking to him about it but he just seems to get agitated when I bring it up he is still willing to do other things to make sure I am happy but it isn’t the same I can tell he isn’t excited and even if I try to do something just for him he stops me.  I asked him if he was cheating on me and that just made him more upset and I really don’t think he is I feel bad about saying it cause I didn’t believe it and I could tell he was hurt by it.  It just seems like he doesn’t want me like I don’t get him excited anymore. I feel like he is slipping away.  If there is something he wants I’d be happy to do it but if he won’t talk to me I can’t fix it.  He knows I couldn’t have cheated on him while I was away and everything that used to get him in the mood before just seems to make him mad now.

relationships,I lied about something stupid and don’t know where to go from here (M22 F20),"I met this girl a town over and we really hit off. After a couple weeks everything is going good and I get a message from someone I fucked 2 years ago (one time drunk) asking if I was at her cousins house. I asked who her cousin was and it was one of my dates housemates. I text her back “yes I am. I have been going on dates with her friend ___ and everything is going good.” She then ignores that message and I figure it’s better not to tell anyone because I’m scared it will create drama.

A week goes by and eventually she finds out and I come clean about the sex. However I lie about the last time she texted me and deliberately don’t tell her about the message because I am worried that she will want to see it and will find my flirty messages from years ago with this girl and freak out.

Cut to yesterday, she is going through my phone and asks to see my messages with her. Instantly she could tell something was up and after 10 minutes of arguing I come clean about how she messaged me and she is mortified that I didn’t tell her about the message for weeks. I fully admitted that it was my fault and I think it’s best we have a couple days to ourselves to think. She kicked me out and I have absolutely no idea where to go from here. I really was trying to keep this girl completely uninvolved because of the drama she brings but I really just brought it onto myself.

relationships,My boyfriend (35M) lied to me (25F) about being married,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for about 3 years, one year ago I met someone who knew him and told me he was married. When I asked him, he told me it wasn’t true and that he was with his previous girlfriend for a long time so maybe that person just assumed they were married. I believed him. 


Today, I found documents that proved they were married and got divorced. I also found his passport that showed he lied to me about his age and he is about 4 years older than he led me to believe. 


I told him that I found some things that showed he has been lying but I didn’t tell him exactly what I found yet. He is at work now and told me to wait in his place until he comes back to explain. I think his explanation will be that maybe he never explicitly told me his age but never denied what I thought either. Or that he told me he wasn’t “married” because he’s not currently married since he got divorced. The last time I found something he hadn’t told me he said that it was HIS past and it’s his choice to tell me about his private life. Does he have a right to withhold this information from me? 


Part of me thinks I should just leave now but another part of me really doesn’t want to be without him. What should I do?

I’m an engineer with a PhD, and I moved to Germany as an expat with my husband, who is also an expat. We have a baby son and are working on building a life here.

I’ve always loved fashion, especially designer bags and clothing. Over the years, I’ve built a collection by buying high-quality pieces, using them, and then reselling them while they still hold value. This way, I get to enjoy fashion without spending too much in the long run.

At work, I have a German friend (let’s call her Anna, 40, F). She’s single, has less work experience, and took longer to settle into a career after switching majors a few times before graduating around 30. She’s not as career-driven as I am (which is fine), but she often complains about her life and relationships. She’s also really into fashion and frequently comments on my designer pieces.

Recently, my husband's company went bankrupt, and he’s now between jobs. We’re financially stable, and he’s actively looking for a new role, so while it’s a stressful time, it’s not a crisis. When I mentioned this to Anna, her immediate response was: *“Well, it’s time to sell your bags.”*

I was caught off guard and didn’t say anything in the moment, but the more I think about it, the more it bothers me. My bags have nothing to do with my husband's job situation, and her comment felt unnecessary and rude. If we were truly struggling, of course, I’d sell them—just like I’d make any other smart financial decision—but just because my husband is looking for a job doesn’t mean we’re suddenly broke.

Now, I’m wondering if this is part of a bigger pattern. She seems to pay a lot of attention to my designer pieces and often makes comments about them. This whole situation is making me question whether she has some weird underlying resentment.

I value our friendship, but this rubbed me the wrong way. Should I bring it up with her? If so, how? Am I overthinking this?

**TL;DR:** My work friend often comments on my designer items. When I told her my husband is between jobs, she said, *""Well, it's time to sell your bags.""* I found this rude and unrelated. Should I bring it up with her, or let it go?",,0,43,2025-04-03 12:52:22

relationships,How can I make my friend realize that her “relationship” is not okay,"This started, when I (16F) went to a local, but kinda big fair all the way back in August with my best friend (also 16F) to get secretly drunk and have fun.

We had bought some alcohol from a grocery store, that didn’t ask for ID before we came. 

When we got there, we decided to stay by some caravans and horses alone until we were pretty drunk. 
It didn’t take long before a man (I’ll call him D, 45M) came up to us and started talking. The conversation quickly turned flirtatious, where he asked us if we wanted to buy some alcohol cheaply at his caravan. We ask him about the caravan and he tells us that he is staying the whole week to sell stuff and is sleeping in the caravan. We say yes to the offer.

The three of us go over to the caravan and we pay for some hard liquor (vodka, sex on The Beach, etc.) The man’s friend (F) comes all of a sudden and says that we should drink together, because that, quote, “would be fun”. I hesitantly decline and tell them our ages and how that would be weird. 
F brushes it off and says I’m being paranoid and we have already paid for the alcohol, so it’s only fair we respect their request. I had no idea what to reply, so I end up agreeing (my best friend said nothing)

As we all get drunker, the men gets closer and closer. D starts trying to feel up my thighs, etc. I get uncomfortable and pull away. Suddenly D says that us girls have to stick together, because a bunch of men only comes to this fair to hurt drunk girls? I get confused as to why he is telling us this and he says that he and his friend wants to protect us. 

They offer us some more free alcohol, and Idk how to decline, so we go to back to the caravan with them. There D asks if we want to become friends on Facebook with them (I decline, but bff says yes) and then they suggest that we sleep together in D’s caravan. 
I ask why again and he says it is to protect us from the “bad guys” because we are drunk. 

My friend says yes to this offer and I finally gets to guts to say no. F promises me that nothing would happen and that they would just look after us. Afterwards he gives me a beer and says that we all probably should have some alcohol to make the night fun again. 

I get mad, say to them that we’re leaving and threaten to call my dad if they refuse. They agree to let us leave, but promise that they never had bad intentions. My best friend gets mad at me for ruining the night for her.

I call my mom and she picks us up. 

When I finally arrive home, my parents yell at me for 2 hours for getting drunk without permission. They also think I’m high, because I smell of weed. They ask me to sort this out with my bff and I try.

Now recently she’s told me that she speaks to F regularly and they might soon have a relationship. I ask her why she thinks that is a good idea and she responds that F and D are nice people and I judge them without reason. 

I have told her to stop the relationship because it makes me uncomfortable and she doesn’t listen. We got into an argument 5 days ago about this and she says that I’m overreacting and I’m letting my prejudices win. 

How can I make her listen or am I in the wrong?

To clarify, the age of consent is 16, so nothing illegal there.

Tl;dr: My bff has started a relationship with a 45 year old man and I’m afraid he’s just using her",,0,4,2025-04-02 23:02:39
relationships,Am I (M18) doing something wrong with my friendships?,"I (M18) am currently a high school senior, about to go to college in the fall. Throughout my four years of high school, I have felt very alienated from others, despite my efforts to try my best to be a good friend, and participating in and contributing greatly in many extracurriculars, even being the president in one case. 

Starting my freshman year, I was coming off of a ghosting of sorts, where my middle school friend group all went to other schools and simply never made an attempt to reach out to me after 8th grade. I am a very introverted and socially anxious person, so it is very hard for me to come up to people and try to make new friends, especially as many people have openly spoken about me while I am in the same room, muttered mean words to me as I pass them in the halls, etc. even to this day. The friends I did have were all always upperclassmen, who were always so amazing about including me and making me feel very comfortable.

Now that I am a senior, I have much more of a circle of friends, but recently, I’ve been feeling very separate from them. I have been experiencing many moments where my friends will choose others over myself to interact with, leaving me alone. Or, I will be in a group, and get left behind in a conversation that everyone can add to but me. It’s kind of a paradox, where I have all these friends, but somehow I always end up on my own by not being one of anyone’s best friends. None of them are intentionally trying to hurt my feelings, but it definitely does.

Whenever I am with my friends, they treat me very delicately because of my more soft-spoken introversion. Their interactions are much more restrained towards me than towards others, like I can’t handle it.

I apologize if this comes off as very complaintive. I just feel very lost, and I feel like something is wrong with me for every person I know to treat me like this. I just really want to keep my friends and avoid what happened in the past.

I feel very alienated from my friends, what can I do to make things better?",,0,1,2025-04-02 21:19:28
relationships,My (19F) boyfriend (20M) wants a 1-2 month break so he can work on himself,"My (20F) boyfriend (19M) and I have been dating for two years and a week ago he decided he needed a lot of space to work on himself. He felt like he had lost his wit, charm, personality, and became sort of depressed. After a confusing week of thinking we were just taking space, he told me we’re broken up, but wants to stay friends for now. He deleted his social media posts of me. But, we’re still exclusive, still in contact, have movie tickets planned for Thursday, etc. He told me he still loves me, and can’t imagine life without me, and hopes to end up with me later, but can’t guarantee anything. He estimated 1-2 months break. We’re not supposed to be doing anything romantic or sexual, but we had sex on Saturday (he initiated) and I can tell he holds back on saying I love you.
I’m trying to trust the fact that he truly just needs time for himself and have faith that we will get back together by the end of April. Am I right to trust that? And no, he is not getting with other people. We fully trust each other with exclusivity.  Plus I can see on Discord that all he’s been doing is playing video games for several hours a day. 

I can’t help but feel really sad, mourning and grieving as if it was a true clean break. But I actually don’t know if it will be. 

I’m gonna stick it out for a month. Is there something I can be doing to make him come back? Should I keep waiting and being supportive, or try to move on?

TLDR: Me and bf are on a break for him to improve himself, kinda friends with benefits, trying to have faith we will come back ",,0,36,2025-04-03 03:40:35

relationships,20m Potential first relationship and its with someone with BPD 21m,"TLDR: this guy I just started seeing has BPD, I'm a bit worried since this would be my first relationship and I feel like I might be a bit in over my head. Im thinking of breaking it off but I'm not sure how or if its too early.

I've never been in a relationship before because I 20m was really awkward and went to a really small highschool. Now that I'm in college I wanted to start dating and I eventually relented and downloaded a dating app where I matched with a guy 21m (im Bi). I saw that he joked about having BPD on his profile but I wasn't super concerned because I have a friend who has it and me and her have a great relationship. Things started off really well and he was eager to meet up which was great for me because Im really indecisive and hate planning things. We ended up going on a date last week and it went really great, he took me to his place after and I had sex for the first time which I was fine with but I felt a little weird because It was only the first date and I don't know him that well. He wanted to see me later that week but I said no cause I was busy. He now wants to see me again this week and has been texting me almost every day asking how I'm doing and that he's horny. This kinda freaked/stressed me out so a looked into BPD more and started to feel like I'm not ready for this kind of relationship.

Part of me enjoys not having to worry about planning things or initiating sex, but another part feels like I should have a more stable relationship especially since i'm pretty new to this. Im thinking about meeting him again this week and unless things get better telling him how I feel. Im a bit worried that this is too early in the relationship to do something like this and things may turn around if I just wait. Is it to early to talk to him about this and if not what would be the best way.",,1,3,2025-04-02 19:53:24
relationships,"Fiancé 33 M inappropriate relationship with female co-worker, how to move on?","Update - Talked to him again. Did not go well at first. He got angry that I was bringing it up again and tried to make me out to be the bad guy because we already talked about it and he thought we were fine. I was very upset and went to the bathroom to cry. Felt really defeated. Came back and told him I don't know how to move on. I understand he feels okay but I don't. Said I needed to understand what he was thinking and if he ever told them their actions were not okay or if he helped create the environment. He told me he didn't encourage it but he admitted at one point he asked what times he should text her so her boyfriend wouldn't find out. I was like how the fuck do you think that's appropriate behavior. Even if you aren't trying to do anything you are involving yourself in a mess, supporting things you claim you don't, and creating and environment in her mind that say she is okay to cross boundaries. He said it wasn't like that at all he just doesn't like the guy so didn't think it mattered. I explained the other guy doesn't even matter. This is how you are presenting yourself to her and everyone in your work environment who knows the situation and creating an sending her the wrong message. He also admitted maybe he was subconsciously hiding his phone since she was hiding stuff from him and maybe he thought it was wrong but he's not sure. I told him I thought he should write her a message saying that he didn't feel it was appropriate to continue talking to her behind boyfriend's back, even if he's a jerk you are choosing this and I'm not comfortable being involved or possibly getting dragged into something. He said if she texted him again he would because he didn't want her to get hurt. This wasn't really what I wanted to hear. I asked why her wellbeing suddenly mattered more than saving our relationship? Why was he doing this for months without concern of the boyfriend hurting her if he found out but now he wait to tell her because she might get hurt. I conceded for now. It's pretty emotionally exhausting. I appreciate everyone's thoughts. 

This is a follow up - for full details you can read my last post if you'd like.

Long story short, my finacé 33 M was texting a female co-worker frequently and acting weird about it. I am 38 F we have been together 3 years and have 2 children.

I confronted him - he said I could read his texts, I declined. He said nothing was going on they were just friends and he was sorry it made me uncomfortable and he didn't have to talk to her.

Now onto the update and to now. 

I remembered a conversation we had about her prior to all this where he said she blocked him on FB and stopped talking to him and he found out it her boyfriend told her he didn't want her talking to him. I asked if she was still dating this man and he said yes. I said so you guys are talking behind her boyfriend's back, he said yes. He then proceeded to tell me she is also cheating on that boyfriend. 

I told him I feel this is all incredibly inappropriate. That he should not be speaking to this person. Not only is it inappropriate but what if her boyfriend who he said threatened her and was an abusive jerk decided to retaliate against him? What if he comes to our home where our children are? Had he ever considered that? Or blasted him on FB for talking to his girlfriend. I know it's possibly shallow but I don't want to be the fiancé of someone with a reputation like this. It's a small town. This girl clearly has no boundaries. On top of all that these are things he claims he is against, yet he is promoting and supporting this decietfulness and infidelity in her. 

That's where I am stuck. I feel like I am questioning his morals and judgement. Like his actions have spoken volumes above his words. I know if the tables were turned he'd absolutely not be okay with me having done it. I wanna think he just stupidily didn't think any of this through. 

How do I move on from this? Should I continue working through it with him. What do I even say? I'm going to discuss with my therapist I just appreciate and thoughts or perspective. 

Thanks!

relationships,"my girlfriend (26F) keeps questioning if she needs to be alone, what do I (24F) do?","My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years and 9 months. We have definitely had our fair share of fights or bickering matches. She's told me several times that she doesn't like the bickering and it's not fun for her. It's never been fun for me either but I'm well aware of what I could've been doing to cause it. A lot of our bickering matches/fights have been caused due to my anxiety/overthinking. Whether it's me letting her know too many little things that bother me or the constant assuming she would leave me eventually. But we have had so many great moments. I've grown so much as a person since I've met her. She's been having a lot going on recently. Her mother's sick and is declining. She's confused about life and her wants/needs. She wants to change careers. And again yesterday she started telling me about how she feels she needs to be alone to figure herself out. I mentioned couple's therapy and she told me that that wouldn't help because I'm not doing anything wrong. She keeps telling me that it's not me and it's her needing to figure x,y,z out. She tells me she loves me so much but she just feels she needs to break up with me and be alone. But that she doesn't want to break up with me, she just thinks she needs to. I can't help but think I brought her to this point. There's nothing I can do about it now but try and fix things and help her figure out whatever she needs to if she lets me.

relationships,Relationship doubts,"I (25m) have been with my girlfriend (23f) for the best part of 5 years.

Generally, or up until recently, I would've said I was perfectly happy and content. I would've said I love her and she's my better half, we do nice things we support each other etc.

The trouble I face is I have been having some bad anxiety. I have a history of this, so it's not new. But the relationship doubts from the anxiety are overwhelming.

This is my first relationship and first sexual partner, and so I have conjured an idea of being bothered by that (despite not being an issue before as far as I know). Other spiralling thoughts include, ""how do I know if she is the one?"", ""am I really in love?"", ""am I happy?"". Its a whole ordeal. Some doubts I have had in the past, the odd ""maybe i don't love her"", but I have always brushed this off as overthinking. During our relationship, I have always had a bit of anxiousness with the idea of long-term things I.e. marriage or buying a house, we live together, but that was also anxious for me (despite me enjoying our life together now living together). With this new anxiety though, I seem to be dwelling much on this holding meaning.

I am at an impasse and would appreciate people's guidance on if they've experienced thi? I am seeking proffesional help for the anxious thoughts? But I suppose this is just a gathering of views.

We're currently living at her dad's place saving for our future as we are planning on moving out sometime next year.

We get a long well, sex is solid, morals are similar, so why have I been questioning breaking up? I can't justify a good enough reason too. I know there doesn't need to be a huge reason, like, someone cheating to break up, but still...The major flaws to her is she is pretty lazy, sometimes not hygienic, not great with money, doesn't eat clean or go to the gym, is obsessed with dogs where I do not want pets in the future (this is our biggest gripe/compromise to this point). We have talked, and I have told her these issues and I can see she is somewhat trying to work on this, which I do appreciate. 

She is talking about getting engaged soon where I'm playing along, but secretly I'm very nervous about taking the next steps. She is obsessed with me, very loyal and would do anything for me, which I feel is rare to find these days. 

Needless to say, I think I want to be single. and start to love myself fully first before having to rely on eachother for happiness. I also think I want to see if there's something better out there for me, someone who is even more compatible.

wife of 2 year, together 12 years 

loss at what to do and need urgent help. 

my husband has been a drinker since he was 13… he’d get drunk every 2-4 days but recently (the last 2 years) he has been getting better though not afraid it’s enough in my eyes. 

on average a week or every 2, he’ll binge drink 2L of alcohol, noticeably vodka and other contents like beer ect. I find this is abnormal and have told him this, where im usually responded with him flexing it… which makes me sad. 

when he’s drunk  on 2L, he unfortunately cannot go to work and will skip 2 days a week if this happens. I find he won’t go to work up to a maximum  of 5 days a month. He chooses drink and video games with his buddies instead of work. Says he needs it for stress relief 

I have tried countless of therapy for him (thousands of $), medication… outright telling him but im responded with the same thing. 

“I want to enjoy my life and be young because I never got to be. It’s my stress reliever and makes me less depressed. This is the only time I can enjoy life. Stop worrying, I’m fine, plus I don’t get drunk 3 times a week anymore, only 1, so clearly I’m getting better, we even went to the doctors and she said my liver and immune system is great. I won’t get sick, I’m fine”

im sad he would say this when it’s said drinking = more depression and still ruining his insides even if it hasn’t hit him yet

please advise what to do to help him drink less because I don’t want to see him chipping away years off his life

ps guys, 

He’s dependent on me and if I leave him, he will not function on his own (we live in a trailer next to his mother where I sacrificed my hometown to look after him). I’m the sole person who drives him to work and helps with his appointments / takes care of him and I know his mother will not help if I leave. This makes me scared. 

Tldr; husband drinks too much and says it helps him be less depressed, but it’s the exact opposite and I need him to see this despite spending so much on therapy and meds for him, too scared to leave incase he’ll drink himself to death and fall further into the pit, please advise me the best path to help him.

relationships,Should I be concerned about my BF's female friend?,"I (22F) have been dating this guy (22M) for a few months now. To preface, my BF is a sweetheart and has been the best guy I've been with as he has treated me really well so far. I am also usually not the jealous type, as I have not cared much about my exes female friends in the past.

I always knew my BF had a female friend, who I'll call K. K and my BF have been friends since early high school days. However, I noticed he had been texting her or had recent chats with her on his phone. He told me that he was messaging her about an overseas trip she went on. He told me his phone password although I've never asked nor questioned him on anything and I went through his chats with her to quench my curiosity (I know this is ethically wrong as it is an invasion of privacy but in today's current dating climate I don't want to waste my time or youth to a man who communicates via Snapchat) and I found nothing of note.

The only other female friends he has are his friends girlfriend's, who he does not text. My BF also told me I shouldn't worry about her as K wanted to pursue/had a crush on my BF's best friend and brother, never my BF. His brother also mentioned that she was ""just like a sister."" K and my BF also don't hangout in person as far as I know, as he is mostly hanging out with me or his friends. I have not met or spoken to K since meeting my BF. K is a relatively attractive girl and is currently single.

To make matters worse, I've been having dreams that he has been cheating on me multiple times! Is this a sign from God to investigate further, or my subconscious messing with my emotions?

relationships,I feel like he's hiding our relationship,"I’m 34F in a relationship with a 49M. We've been together for about a year, and our bond is strong—there’s deep care, emotional support, and lots of effort on both sides. He’s kind, patient, and always tries to build me up and focus on the positives. He’s involved in my 8-year-old daughter’s life, and we always make time for each other. Despite running two companies, managing multiple properties and tenants, overseeing job sites, and dealing with both physical and mental health issues within his family, he still shows up for me. I try to support him and bring him peace in return.

But I’ve been struggling with a growing sense of emotional imbalance and exclusion. While my friends, family, neighbors—and even my daughter—know him, I remain disconnected from his loved ones. I haven’t met his children, any of his family (who live locally), or his friends, aside from one brief introduction. There have been invitations from them, but he’s chosen to spend that time alone with me instead. He doesn’t tell his workers about me, and when I help with his business, he prefers we act as colleagues so it doesn’t come across as a “mom and pop” operation.

When it comes to his kids he’s protecting what he’s rebuilt with them after years of estrangement and legal challenges. Their mother would react badly if she found out about me. I would never want to jeopardize his access, but the reasons have shifted—from him not being ready, to concerns about my emotional reactions, to now being entirely about their mom. He travels solo to a tropical resort to see his kids, and recently suggested I come but stay in a separate room and not acknowledge him publicly in case the kids saw and mentioned me. 

He’s been clear if I took a trip without him, especially to a resort, it would be a dealbreaker. His reasons for going are valid. His children need him more than I do—but he expects full independence and trust while denying me the same.

Early on, I shared a photo where he appeared in the background—to my friends-only, not tagged, and not on his page. He blocked me on Facebook, saying his ex might see and twist it to make it seem like he had a “new family,”  alienating his kids. I deleted the photo. He later apologized, added me back, and updated his relationship status—but there’s still nothing on his profile to indicate I’m the person he’s with.  I haven’t posted anything else. I can’t help feeling like he’s ashamed of me. He claims their mother is unstable and would retaliate, but she’s a university dean and it’s been five years. I’ve also never spoken to her and wouldn't want to involve myself given his fears. But sometimes it feels like he’s using her as an excuse.

He also felt it was important for me to be open about our relationship, especially with exes who reached out—which I was. He didn’t do the same. I later discovered one of his exes was working for him, which he never told me. When I confronted him and said I wasn’t comfortable, he cut ties—but I do see a pattern.

On the other hand he is sober has a strong moral code and believes in karma. I don’t think he’s cheating. Maybe I’m naïve, but I truly believe he loves me. Still, I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve been compartmentalized. I’ve never given ultimatums— only expressed that it hurts and that I want to feel like we’re equals.

When I bring this up, he becomes unsure about our compatibility and  overwhelmed. He tries to make up for it through caring gestures. He’s incredibly patient with my emotions and quirks, supports me, and makes me feel cherished. I have access to his phone and have never seen anything concerning. He accepts my ADHD and sees the good in me when I struggle to see it in myself.

Am I being too much? He says I will meet everyone in time but no clear timeline or milestone I'm left feeling over invested and like I'm catering to him in the mean time. Am I rushing things? He is a solitary person who values his privacy. I don't want to keep bringing it up when it never seems to change anything. How can I express my needs without him feeling attacked and in a way that isn't a threat to our relationship?


TL;DR: One year in, he’s fully involved in my life, but I’m not part of his. I haven’t met his kids, his local family, or his friends. He has reasons for traveling solo to see his kids but says it would be a dealbreaker if I took a solo trip. I feel like I can’t express my hurt without him shutting down or questioning our compatibility. I want to feel like an equal partner—but I’m starting to wonder if I ever will. I want to make this work and so does he.",,0,23,2025-04-02 17:02:44
relationships,Genuine advice to stop giving too much to others?,"I (35m) am not sure what my problem is but to me it feels like i am doing something wrong. I regularly end up finding my self around women and for whatever reason i always end up spending money on them, they never ask for it, not in a relationship with them or anything. Some sort of friendships/situationships but never anything more, i value friendships more than a relationship. 
The way it works is i usually see them struggling or dreaming or looking at materials and i sort of remember it and when i come across a cheap way to get it for them i will do without thinking too much, eventually i will give it to them as a gift. I have never had an issue attracting women and most of them are not aware of my financial situation, i never speak about it, this is not money related thing. The root cause is my hobbies, I spend a fair bit of money on my hobbies and these gifts are costing me a fraction of what my hobbies are, it genuinely makes me happy seeing them happy but surely this is not normal? Gifts are usually in the range of £20-50, frequency probably every 2-3 months. I guess similar to when people are in relationships but in my case is just a friendship. They won’t gift anything to me and to be fair i genuinely don’t expect or wanting them to do so, anything money can buy i don’t tend to value it much. I assume i exchange money with friendship? They will still be my friends without me spending on them though.

Tl;dr i spend money on women and i believe i have got a problem",,1,12,2025-04-02 16:18:53
relationships,how do i stop comparing myself to that one girl,"My boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have known each other for a few years. We met in high school, where we got together for the first time. He broke up with me because he wasn’t ready for a relationship yet but we stayed friends after that, even though i still had feelings for him because he was my first love. In the time we were ‘friends’, he confessed he had a crush on someone else. He texted me, saying he was excited because they started texting and all that. I started looking her up on Instagram and realised she was prettier than me and i got so insecure. He and this girl were in the same friendgroup so they hung out a lot. She liked his attention and sent pictures of herself. They never kissed or got together though. The weird thing was that he got with me again, not long after he said he liked this girl. I just allowed it because of my feelings for him but i got very insecure because of her and compared myself 24/7. They still texted when we were together and she kept sending her outfits and other silly stuff. We are now almost 5 years later, and i still look at her profile every day. We’re still together, and he lost contact with her because he said she turned into a bad person and seeked attention with multiple guys. One time, she sent actual nudes to him and he had set it as his background on his phone. They also spooned once. No matter how badly he talks about her now, I still think she’s gorgeous and want to look like her. How do I stop comparing myself to her? I’m really desperate because it’s been years and i’m not over it yet :(

TL;DR: I still compare myself to a girl he had a crush on before we got back together. They never dated, but they texted and hung out, and she even sent him nudes. He cut contact and speaks badly about her now, but I still check her profile daily and wish I looked like her. I’m desperate to stop, but after all these years I don’t know how.",,0,4,2025-04-02 19:57:02
relationships,I feel like I need to make my friends choose me or my ex. But I am torn.,"I (22M) am going through a really tough breakup right now. We were together for 3 years. She (22F) cheated on me for about 6 months with our close friend/neighbor.

I had suspicions about it for a while but I trusted her and didn't think she would ever decive me like that. I also kept trying to talk to her about how I was feeling. And tried to mend our relationship many many times through all of this. But everytime I talked to her she would just side- step what I was actually saying. This affair was all completely emotional (trust me ik it's hard to belive lol, but it's true) but it was still very very damaging.

She would spend all of her time with this friend. She would constantly double book plans with both of us and then ditch me to hang out with this friend. She would always prioritize making time for this friend. It was to the point I almost never saw her. Towards the end, this friend was feeling depressed after a mushroom trip. And after that my girlfriend stopped sleeping at home, for weeks. Under the guise of being ""worried"" about our friend.

That was really the nail in the coffin. I finally told my gf that what she was doing was cheating. And then she left me a week later.


There's a lot more that went on, I felt very lonely and isolated during those last 5 months especially. Because I was constantly trying to reconnect with my girlfriend, only to be pushed aside every time. I didn't know she had one foot out because she hid it so well around me. And I have never felt more alone and unloved.

I took her on a trip to see billie eilish in concert during this time. And looking back I truly belive that Is the only reason she was staying with me. Because she was acting distant before the trip. But during it was like I had my girlfriend back, and we had such a good time. But the moment we got home she started blowing me off again. Not even like a day or two later she was blowing me off for this friend. And looking back that tells me all I need to know.

There is a lot of stuff that happened after the breakup. I was hospitalized, and my ex was extremely cold and mean to me during this time despite all the shit she put me through. I had never seen this side of her before. And it was really hard to come to grips with seeing her in that light.

Anyways, the thing I want to get to is my friends. We have a few friends that we share. And they all have heard everything taht went down and want to just stay neutral. And honestly I thought I could be okay with them not picking sides. But I am honestly not so sure anymore.

I want to be okay with them sitting on the fence, but I just don't feel they are providing me the right support right now. It feels like everytime they try to hear me out they just defend my ex's actions. I know they aren't doing it on purpose but it's still damaging.

I know that making people pick a side is wrong. But I can't keep being around people who are around my ex. Because it feels like they're condoning the behavior and supporting it. But I am scared to make that choice to tell them about it. Because I know they won't choose me. I am really lost as to whether I am making the right choice by cutting them off if they want to keep contact with my ex.

TLDR: Had a bad breakup, gf cheated on me for months. Friends want to stay neutral, but I am having a hard time with that. Because of the way everything went down with my ex.",,1,11,2025-04-02 15:49:52
relationships,"How do I cope with sudden loss, health issues and partner pulling away without resentment towards them?","TW: mentions of health concerns, mentions of death

Tl;dr: In the same week I (31f) found out I have a tumor, a family member committed suicide and my partner (27m) seems to be ghosting

Long story short, my long-term partner started pulling away recently and visibly reducing our communication/time together without explaining. I already posted about it on reddit and then all the other stuff happened and I feel like Im trolling in some sick sort of way and I really wish I was.

I tried talking to him and asking what was going on, but he wasn't in the headspace to talk and asked for space. Since he previously expressed that feeling overwhelmed makes him shut down (we had some conflict about the amount of in person time because once every 4 weeks made me feel like he didnt want to see me, but he felt too overwhelmed for more), I really wanted to be understanding and did not force contact or anything and let him initiate in his own time. During that time, he'd check in sporadically, maybe every 2-3 days. I told him that, if he needs to be by himself its ok and that if he at some point wants to talk about it he is welcome to do so.

However, during that same time, my health issues increased and I ended up finding out it's due to a tumor. In the same week I found out about the tumor, a loved one commited suicide. In that same week, my partner decided to completely cut contact with me without relling me (at one point I broke my own promise that Ill give him space and called only to find out the number is blocked). Right now, I feel absolutely shattered from all sides.

I know I cant blame him for anything since these events are jarring for anyone and since he seems to be going through his own struggles, I cant expect him to manage my emotions. I know he isn't supposed to coddle and 'babysit' me and probably doesnt have the capacity for that too on top of other things he might be going through, and thats fair. 

However, on an emotional level, I have such a hard time remaining understanding and supportive of him because I feel like he abandoned me. I am aware of my abandonment issues, and I know they are something I need to process myself, but at the same time, in my heart I have that nagging ""Wow really? Now? When Im sick? When I have to figure out a funeral? If you cared, you wouldn't do this to me now. I get youre feeling overwhelmed, but for fucks sake so do I."" which is basically me guilt tripping him in my mind even though I'm aware he didnt do it because he hates me and it ultimately 'is what it is' and everyone has the right to part ways when the relationship isnt working for what they need anymore. Rationally, Im thinking ""I appreciated our time together and understand we are in different places right now and while neither of us are necessarily bad people, right now we arent good for eachoter and I wish you all the best."" but emotionally Im thinking ""Fuck youu!""

At the same time I just wish I was able to talk to him and tell him Im scared and confused and angry at everything that happened and get a hug and cry but then again how do I reconcile that with not trauma-dumping on others since death and illness really isnt a nice topic for anyone.

I just dont know how to handle all of this at once. Half of it doesnt even seem real. How do I even determine what is an acceptable response on my side and/or on my partners side in these kinds of situations?

How do people even navigate relationships during some sort of life-crisis in a healthy manner? How do I stop feeling resentful? How do I even go through all this?

I made an appointment with a therapist.

relationships,I (21F) am dating my co-worker (25M) (update!),"This is an update on my post yesterday! (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/O5vYATLni6) thank you to everyone who gave me advice and a few ways to deal with this whole issue. I’m happy to let you guys know that i ended things with him. 

Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) he didn’t show up to work today (for unknown reasons) and i’d discussed it with my friends (who were also supportive of me breaking up with him) and curated some texts to send him. Usually, i wouldn’t break up with someone over text, it feels rude, but he ignored me all day despite me texting him a polite good morning, and then asked my colleague/our mutual friend (23F, i’d mentioned her in the first post, the ‘girl bestie’) if i’d shown up to work today. 

She was kind of irritated with him too because he spoiled her mood by complaining to her about me, and when i told her the whole story, she agreed that it was pointless and that he was immature, stubborn and insecure. 

So i dropped him a bunch of texts, apologizing for not talking to him for these past 2 days (i was upset and annoyed, and he was just adding to it with his persistence) and that i’d thought about it, and decided it wouldn’t work out between us, that there’s no hard feelings, he didn’t do anything wrong to me and that i thought i was ready for a relationship but i was wrong, we’re better off as friends or co-workers. 

And, as expected, all i got (after 5 texts explaining what i’d been going through) he simply responded with ‘ok.’ 

Okay i guess?? 

Question: If he starts talking to me again, should i just keep this amicable? 

tl:dr, i ended a relationship with my co-worker that would’ve turned toxic and now he’s butthurt and will likely complain to our colleagues about me some more. ",,0,2,2025-04-02 15:36:13
relationships,I 17M am not over my ex 17F and I’m in a new relationship,"I just want to start by saying I know I am a terrible person for this and I just don’t know what to do

I am 17M and I dated my first girlfriend for 10 months, my whole junior year, and then over the summer I broke up with her for no reason (in hindsight). My reasoning at the time was that I was bored and essentially I just wanted to be a player (cringe ik). I really hate myself for ever doing that. At the beginning of this year, my senior year, this other girl texted me on instagram and we started talking and eventually I asked her out mid-October. A little over a month ago, I had a dream about my first girlfriend and ever since then I have just not been able to forgive myself for breaking up with her and I just miss her so much. I am my current girlfriend’s first boyfriend and I just can’t bring myself to say anything. I don’t want to ruin another girl’s first relationship. But I can’t get over my first love. I don’t know where these feelings came from. After the breakup until when I had the dream, I didn’t have a care in the world. I was an even worse person than I am now. My current girlfriend, 16M per subreddit rules, has had all of her previous talking stages and such ruined by the guy’s ex, and so I just feel absolutely terrible about the situation. My ex is dating another guy and I crumble inside whenever I see them together. I just want her back but I can’t just leave my girlfriend. She talks about our future so much. It would destroy her.

This is the main idea, but I am more than willing to give more details if needed. Please, anybody, what should I do?

relationships,What do we do about our sex life? Am I being the bad guy?,"How do we gain a better sex life?

Myself (24M) and my partner (24F) have been together for 6 years and have a 3 year old child. Most of our relationship we have been pretty polar opposites when it comes to sex. I have quite a high sex drive where as she has practically 0

As stupid as it sounds, when I was younger I enjoyed the chase, so the sex life thing didn’t really bother me until about a year in. 5 more years and a child later, it’s probably as stale as it’s ever been. Any intimacy we have feels very forced. Sometimes it’s at the point where I try to talk about how I feel, that night something will happen then nothing after weeks. 

I’ve been in my own head a lot lately that she doesn’t have a drive because of me. That said, she’s never had a drive and to mention that I was her first person she was with. 

I’ve started to feel bad for feeling sexual towards my own partner, like I’m doing something wrong. Sometimes I feel my partner is staying for the comfortability that we have a child and are a family and she doesn’t want to break that. 

We are not sure if her non sex drive is medical, phycological or really just her as a person. She has always been too scared to find out as sex to her is a very taboo subject. 

Should we reach out for therapy first? Am I wrong for second guessing our relationship due to a lack of sex? Heads a wee bit all over but judging by some of the posts in here I’m not alone…

TL:DR, my partner and I haven’t had a sex life for most of our relationship, is it time we delved into why?",,0,23,2025-04-02 19:04:13
relationships,Wondering if I (21M) should send a message to my former friend (22F) to get stuff off my chest,"I (21M) was friends with 22F for about a year. Starting in January this year, things went south and we had many arguments over small things, which spiralled into big arguments. Shortly after one ended, another one began etc. I won’t go into the details of them here because they’re not really relevant to my question and they’re long stories.

Eventually, we both just stopped communicating. I stopped replying to her first and then shortly after she stopped texting me. Last time, we texted was a few weeks ago. We both went to a college event yesterday and were at the same table, yet we didn’t really speak. So it’s safe to say the friendship is pretty much over sadly.

Thing is, I believe she was mostly at fault with this friendship ending. She was mostly responsible for these little problems turning into big arguments. She was very hostile and personally attacked me many times. During our arguments, I bit my tongue a lot and held back many times. A lot of times I should’ve stood up for myself and told her she was wrong, I didn’t. I was a people pleaser and I didn’t want the friendship to end so I often pretended everything was fine when it wasn’t. A lot of times she hurt me, I didn’t say anything.

I want to send her a message basically telling her this and how she was responsible for it ending. (Because she’s probably going around telling her friends the opposite). 

Obviously, she doesn’t have to be friends with me if she doesn’t want to, that’s her choice but I feel I need to tell her this stuff before we part ways. This is mostly for my own peace of mind. It’s happened several times in the past where I didn’t speak up for myself and then I came to regret it severely. I want to send this message to “get it off my chest”, so to speak. I don’t really care if she replies and I’m not doing this to try and reconcile. Obviously, it would be nice if that happened but I’m not expecting it nor getting my hopes up. I feel I need to send this message to move on, but I’m worried it’ll come across as unhinged doing so.

relationships,I (19F) got back with my bf (20M) after his father passed away but I don't romantically like him anymore (READ FOR CONTEXT!!),"**BRIEF CONTEXT REGARDING BREAKUP (scroll down if you want to skip)**

We initially broke up after he openly disrespected me behind my back in front of my friends a couple days before valentines, my friends defending me DIRECTLY telling him that he should be treating me better by paying for our date rather than me paying - this was all recorded (since i wasn't there) and i heard his tone of voice saying it - how unbothered he was:

>""Oh \_\_\_'s already fiending over me, its fine""  
Friend: ""you should make her a card!!"" Bf: ""eh..""

we've been together for 2 years and he never considered getting me a gift (he wasnt financially the greatest which is fine, but i gave him countless handmade gifts to express myself - i just wanted to know he appreciates me - even a card would've been nice), or did anything thats considered ""the bare minimum"" according to my friends.  
He never saw me as a ""priority"" and instead viewed me as a simple pastime, cuddling - anything to fill the intimite void, or even a relationship you'd find in secondary school. Constantly prioritising his friends - even MY BEST FRIEND over my feelings.  
He has a good heart, and I know he's capable of caring however his lack of experience really shows. He is also neurodivergent (autistic) if that helps, i did my initial research on this, and i became more direct as a person *(after my first outward emotional outburst based on the assumption that he prefers my best friend over me - which we moved on from)* to try and account for this

Anyway, after i found out from my close friends i was shattered. I opened my eyes - looked at the massive bag of crafting supplies *(for his gift)* in my hand and went ""what the fuck am i doing"".  
Sent voicenotes expressing my feelings and how i want to break up, met up irl to talk about it more - we both agreed we wanted to focus and better ourselves so we left on good terms and on ""break""  
no set time regarding how long, and a strict ""NO CONTACT RULE"", and we weren't exclusive to eachother  
After a while i was convinced it was a full on breakup, he broke the rule a couple of times to try and flex the fact he's capable of performing simple daily tasks consecutively (brushing teeth, showering..)  
his hygiene was.... concerning (no deodorant, greasy hair..) but i still loved him either way before the breakup.

My friends pointed out all of his flaws post-breakup which leads to 👇

# GETTING BACK TOGETHER - FEELINGS GONE (main title comes in)

so a month goes by, day before this i sent a proper breakup text stating how i've lost feelings completely  
im working on coursework and i get a message from him saying

>""so uh.. my father passed away""

i was in disbelief, his father was all he and his sister had. He has no mother since she disappeared years ago, i was incredibly worried. i still deeply cared about him and had no idea what was gonna happen to him. I kept messaging him to get an idea of the situation, along with keeping him company and allowing him to process his feelings. I felt like shit since the sequence of events is just too cruel.  
From losing his friends, to his girlfriend, to his only father  
i felt horrible

timeskip to a few days later he's 5 hours away from me (by car) now - we're talking on vc again since i want him to have company. I missed hearing his voice - i missed the yap sessions we had, i just missed him. didnt help that all of my other irl friends are in a relationship. I had to watch them all makeout the day before - shit was miserable.  
things are getting slightly intimate ""i wish you were here rn"" ""i miss you"" ""i want you""  
he had clearly changed since he was never this affectionate before  
he started doing things that i had to beg him to even consider doing with me (like pinkie promises) - which made me really happy but in the back of my mind im thinking:

>""why now? why not during the 2 years we were together?""

i tried expressing this to him and he gave me an apology for only realising how much i meant to him after this long, its like they say. you never realise what you've lost until its gone.  
at the time i was able to reciprocate this love since i really did miss him. and was happy he was back with me.  
he asked me:

>""Is it wrong to want to get back together?""

I said no at the time, even though i was scared of getting hurt this badly again - in my head i wanted to give us another chance and agreed. so we're back together

but all of this happening right after his father passed away feels so fucked up, i dont want to get back with him because i ""pity"" him  
i dont know how i feel now  
it's only been about a week or so, i cant even say ""i love you"" while meaning it. and thinking about it is stressing me out since i dont know how i really feel - is this a phase? do i tell him how i feel? do i just breakup? is this relationship beyond fixing? do i even want to fix this relationship?

i used to be so obsessed with him, putting him on this massive pedestal and even almost losing my closest friends because of how much i prioritised him  
all of those feelings are long gone  
i can't tell my friends about this since i know they'll just be disappointed in me for getting back with him after exposing everything he's done and recognising how bad it really was  
i somewhat miss the solitude i had, but at the same time i dont wanna be alone  
i like him and i do care about him, but i dont know if i can say i ""love"" him - if those feelings i once had will ever come back  
my time alone kinda changed me ig, i was able to feel what it's like to sorta ""love myself""  
i dont know how to process my feelings  
I'm just scared of hurting him since he really is trying, but also damaging my mental health by faking my feelings for his happiness

gng please help im begging 😭🙏

**TL;DR; : Gave my bf another chance to prove to me that he has changed right after his single father passed away. He has changed, however I'm convinced I have lost feelings, but its only been a week since we got back and I dont know what to do, I cant even say ""I love you"" without meaning it. I don't know what to do.**",,0,2,2025-04-02 21:04:44
relationships,My (14F) Desi parents' (38F) (40M) relationship is crumbling.,"I don't post or use Reddit often. I just thought these people would understand.

My 38F mother and 40M father have been in a neglected relationship for years now. For context, my mother is a very emotional person who has OCD and went to therapy for it (it's not 'cured') and my father is an emotionally distanced man who puts time and care into me and my little sister (6F) but no energy to my mother. They can't even have a conversation without my father turning it into an argument. As a father, he's the best I know and he'll forever be my superhero. But as a husband, he holds so many significant flaws I can't bare sometimes. Whereas as a mother, she lacks multiple flaws and gets into my nerves every single time, but as a woman I feel her so deeply that it moves me to tears. My mother is also mainly financially dependent on my father - she works at a grocery store, but that not enough. She also stays home all day (not my fathers fault) and doesn't have much friends. I hope my mom gets to speak her sadness and live the life she always wanted, be the independent woman she always envied and be loved the way she always desired. Couples therapy is probably not on the table due to cultural reasons & the price - I don't think my father will spend more than 140 EUR on one session for his wife. Date nights NEVER happen, and I don't think they have intimacy because my little sister still sleeps in the same bed as them. And my mother can't even talk about this to anyone in the world because her family lives in South Asia (we're in Europe) and she doesn't want to put stress on them.  Is there anything I can do or suggest to help my parents?

TLDR; Desi parents are good people but not compatible with eachother, won't divorce. Can I do anything to help?",,2,2,2025-04-02 08:43:47
relationships,I 24M and my girlfriend 25F have been having issues between me and my friend group(the boys) but I do not know who to believe and I would just like some type of advice maybe someone else has gone through something similar ?,"So I'm going to start out with how we started dating and give a little detail. So I worked at this restaurant for about 3 years and I left for about 6 months and that's when my girlfriend started working there but we hadn't met or anything and whenever I came back things happened and we started talking eventually dating but before we did she was with a other guy who at the time she says treated her bad and would yell at her and I guess say verbally abuse because he tended to call her names a lot too.

But one night it was me and her and we were in my car after work and we decided to take a spin around the block and her at the time boyfriend who was telling her he was going to leave her and all sorts of crazy things, decided to show up after we drove back into the restaurant and was yelling at her and asking for his stuff back from her car but the thing is he wouldn't grab the stuff he just kept tryna yell at her and all types of things well I decided I was gonna intervene before anything happened and I got all in his face confronted him and that's when he chilled out.

 Well they broke up and we ended up dating and the thing is a month later (I did not know about this until 1yr in our relationship) she decided to go out to eat with him and I never knew till 1yr when I checked her memories on snap and there she had a picture of him just him in the pic eating I was so close to leaving I didn't tho smh. Well this is where I'm having the issues with my friends because now we are about to be 3 years in about 2-3 weeks and well me and my girlfriend decided to go out with my friends for his birthday and we all drank and had a good time but closer to the end of the night she was telling me that one of my friends(24M) was touching on her leg and like rubbing it and she was uncomfortable and to swap seats and we did and I also confronted him but he didn't say much just apologized. 

Well come to find out the day after he talked to our other friend and they had a talk with me saying that that's not how the night went and that she was the one touching on my friend and that there was a video that they recorded but ""don't have"" anymore bc it was a story and they deleted it when someone slid up and said my girlfriend was touching on my friend and not me. Also while I went to the bathroom she grabbed my friends hand and put it on her butt(he says and she says that's not true) And see the thing is we had been drinking so I can't say I remember it all but my thing is I remember how she did me dirty in the beginning so am I wrong for not really believing her when my friend hasn't lied to me(from what I know in the past) since we were in middle school. I want to leave but at the same time I don't and maybe it could be because I love her or maybe just because she lives with me and my parents now. I don't know if it's important but she moved in with me after basically running away from her parents because they wouldn't let her see me at like 23yrs old but she said her ex was really crazy so yeah maybe that had a play in why her parents said stuff but she moved in probably about 1yr and a half in. I will also add she lets me see her phone anytime I feel like and isn't nervous or anything and I don't feel like she's done anything shady, we tend to go see her parents now and they love me even her sister(30F). Maybe it's just me but I wouldn't bring someone around my family if I wasn't serious about it and she always talks about getting married but ima be honest I'm scared of it I don't want to but she always says she wants. What advice could yall say?



TLDR:
He started dating his girlfriend after working together at a restaurant. She had a toxic ex, and they got together after he stood up for her. A year into the relationship, he found out she had gone out to eat with the ex shortly after they started dating, which hurt him. Now, almost three years in, a recent incident happened where his girlfriend said his friend touched her inappropriately while drunk. But the friend claimed she was the one being inappropriate and says there's a now-deleted video proving it. He's conflicted because he doesn't fully trust her due to the past, but he still loves her—and she now lives with him and his family. He’s unsure whether to leave or stay",,0,3,2025-04-02 14:22:39
relationships,My (F19) boyfriend’s (M20) parents recently got divorced and now he’s questioning his feelings for me.,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 9 months now and we were so in love. He flew to my country over winter break to the country I go to college in and we were so happy and I realize that he is exactly the person that I want to spend my life with. I know I’m young, but I don’t date someone that I don’t see a potential future with. We talk a lot about our future and he is flying over to see my family in the summer. After New Years he flew back to the country he goes to college in and started acting weird. He finally revealed to me that his parents are getting a divorce and he’s scared and it’s negatively impacting him and our relationship. Three months later he told me that he doesn’t feel romantic feelings for me anymore but he still wants to keep me in his life (he stresses that he can’t bear the thought of losing me completely) and that he loves and respects me as a person. 

He seemed to change entirely. He got himself injected with a contraception because he suddenly fears having children (we don’t even have sex and we’re long distance) even though he’s known to previously adore children very much and is very family-oriented. We had talked a lot about how we would raise our family and he even made a list of possible names for our children. He used to sleep around before getting in a relationship with me and he told me that he would rather find someone right for him and invest in that relationship (me). Now, he told me that he is asexual (when he used to be very sexual and hooked up with a lot of people in high school) and I think it’s because of the contraception. He also suddenly told me that we’ve been moving too fast in the relationship and that we should just “date and see where it goes” when before he was the one who told me that he would fight to build a future for us. 

Since his parents’ divorce, he stopped talking to me as much. Sometimes he also lashes out at me and apologizes saying he doesn’t know what’s wrong with him. 

We’re on a break right now so he could have space and organize his thoughts on the relationship. He has ADHD so he gets extremely overwhelmed when faced with issues. He told me he doesn’t have the emotional capability to be in a relationship and love me romantically the way I deserve. I know it’s selfish but I can’t believe that after nine months of being completely in love and devoting everything to each other he’s considering throwing it all away, even though I know it’s because of his parents’ divorce. I love him so much and I can’t imagine being with anyone else, and this is breaking my heart. I feel like I woke up one day and my boyfriend is suddenly a complete stranger. What should I do?

relationships,"I (22F) am exhausted by my Father's behavior and unfair treatment, but I can't Bring myself to distance myself from him even as resentment grows.","My relationship with my father has always been complicated. I've spent years trying to engage with him, show him love, and be there for him, but it feels like no matter what I do, he's always picking fights and is mad at me.
An example would be the time when we had some celebrations, I spent three days in a row making desserts, hoping to share them with my relatives that visit. I even asked my father, ""Would you like some?"" And made him some first, but he kept saying, ""I can't, my stomach hurts."" I understood, but then when some guests came over, he commented, ""So there's no dessert for me?"" and ""You make it for others but not your father?"" My mom tells me he's ""just kidding,"" but it doesn't feel like that to me there's no smile or laugh to show it's a joke, I'm just left out here guessing and tbh it doesn't seem like a joke.. that's how it always plays out.

He also ignores me a lot. I've developed  a habit a while ago of just saying ""Listen... listen"" or ""Right? Right?"" Most of the time just to get him to acknowledge me, which has been pointed out by others. It's like I have to beg for his attention, and when I ask him why he doesn't listen, he says things like, ""You need all the eyes on you to talk,"" but still doesn't pay attention. It's exhausting. I just want to talk to him like a daughter talks to her father, ask for advice, joke, laugh, but he doesn't seem interested, and it's hard for me to understand why because he listens to everyone just not me...

I've also had to help him with his work multiple times with my older brother, when I was younger I could let it slide since I couldn't really say no and I didn't  have much responsibilities back then but I grew up now and my brother grew up I have my own life and stuff to do, but he would basically force me to go help, He'd take my phone away so I could help him, and when we got home, I couldn't do anything for myself because he'd take away all my things and tell me to sleep. The next day, I'd wake up and go with him again, no matter how exhausted I was. I swear if he would say ""i need help"" or not even say anything at this point just tell me to help I would do that no hesitation, to me that's my duty to help my parents if I can but the problem is that he would literally force me.

My brother, overall was more detached, at that time he was ranting a house somewhere and working so he wasn't at home and didn't come to help, I felt so tired and wronged that I told him about it and he suggested that I called my aunt to take me away to go to the ""doctor"" for migraines, just to leave and stay somewhere else literally a whole plan...

A bit after that we had to leave our apartment, and even though there was a deadline, my father kept delaying and didn't bring his stuff (since he doesn't like us touching or throwing away anything even though he hoards a lot of useless stuff). And then he blamed it on me and said that I should go with my mother to pack the things even though he is the only one that drives and we need the car since the house is far and also because we transport our stuff with it. My brother wasn't around at that time and frankly said he won't come help and told him to hire someone istead but my dad refused, so I ended up carrying everything myself. I'm very short and not that strong I know it's  not an excuse but i really did feel my back hurt like never before and my father didn't even care and kept adding stuff for me to carry, from the 6th floor...

On top of all of this, there's trauma from the past that still affects me to this day. When my mom had to undergo open heart surgery which was basically guaranteed to fail, I found out that my father had been emotionally involved with another woman, someone who worked with him. I was young at the time, and it broke me. I couldn't focus on my studies because of it, and on top of that, I was still the one that takes care of the house, clean, and cook. He even yelled and hit me during that time. All I could think was, ""Are we not enough for him?"" My mom thankfully survived it and i got to know that she knew about it, but it was never really talked about, my brother confronted him once and only because my dad was acting very harsh and said something along the lines of us not being worth it to call as his children, but nothing truly changed after that and life went on without us solving this situation and that silence still hurts deeply and I still feel resentment.

I've tried to move on from this by working on myself, but the pain lingers, and sometimes I feel like I'm the one being blamed for everything. 

The most recent argument was about my brother giving me his phone which I wanted for quite a bit of time, my father basically turned it into me hidding that from him and then said I'm like his sisters and brothers hiding stuff from him and that he doesn't understand why and if we think that he brings misfortune to us if we told him about it and then said that me, my mother and brother have just the same blood as my aunts and uncles and that we are bad just like them...

The problem is that my brother had told me that he will give it to me when my father was present and wasn't  hiding it at all.

When that argument started i I was shocking up not able to breath from crying which never happened to me before I had difficulty breathing my mom rushed to me but my father just left the room.
my brother was sleeping but then woke up, he had been listening for a bit so he started talking out loud for him to hear, and said the same things that i said and added that even if we hide that's literally what he himself does ... and said ""I'll buy and give you every device that you want"" and later on in my room my brother told me that I don't listen when he and my mother tell me to ignore my father and just talk to him when necessary, but I can't just distance myself from my dad like that. I feel guilty just thinking about doing that, because i know he is like that because of trauma and sadness from his childhood and how his sisters and brothers didn't  and don't appreciate him when he basically was the one that raised them as he was the oldest, i get it, and we do get along when he isn't acting like this, but I also can't help but be sad or mad or feeling like it's unfair to me that he acts like this towards me. 

The examples might seem silly which I think they are and he is making a big deal out of nothing but a lot of things happened that are too long to rant about or that I just literally forgot about from trauma.

Now, I'm at a point where I don't know what to do anymore. I can't keep feeling like this, it feels like a never ending cycle moving out is not an option since here in my country we live with our parents till we get married and I'm not looking to get married any time soon, and I don't want to give up on my father. I'm just exhausted and hurt. I want to improve our relationship or just be at peace with myself, but I don't know how to keep trying when it feels like I'm the only one putting in the effort and he doesn't seem to notice it. In fact my brother who ignores my father gets treated better but when i try to do that too I get worse treatment. How can I stop feeling like I'm the problem, and how do I find peace in this situation? How can I fix my relationship with him even though I do have some resentment because of what he did? And how can i heal?

TL;DR: My relationship with my father has always been complicated. No matter how much I try to connect with him, he picks fights, ignores me, and makes hurtful comments. He has also forced me into exhausting labor and was emotionally involved with another woman during my mother's critical surgery. A recent argument left me in a panic attack, and he just walked away. My family tells me to distance myself, but I can't because I understand that it's  his own trauma. Leaving isn't an option since, in my country, it's expected to live with family until marriage, and I don't plan on getting married anytime soon. I feel exhausted, hurt, and resentful, but also guilty I don't want to give up on him. How do I fix this relationship, heal and find peace?",,1,6,2025-04-02 13:42:36
relationships,I(22f) feel extremely disconnected from my boyfriend(21),"Ive been avoiding thinking about this for like a year but I cant anymore and i need help. I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years, its been good but uneventful. We dont fight, we dont go out, we dont do anything. I love him to death and he has been the most emotionally stable person ive ever had in my life. But the past year i’ve realized how much ive lost myself throughout the relationship, I dont know who I am, and now I feel like I have just became a version of him. He grounds me and my emotions, but I think he grounds me to much. I spent 3 years not going out with my friends, its not like i wasn’t allowed by him, i just didn’t allow myself because i felt like i had to stay with him.  He talks about me like I am the one for him, and Ive convinced myself to “push through it” so i wouldn’t hurt him. But it hasn’t gotten better. 

We would just stay home together, just watching tv or him playing his games. I was content but nothing to be thrilled over, then I started going out with my friends. Making new friends and learning alot about myself and it just made me sad. I was so sad that I couldn’t feel that excitement with my boyfriend. He is my BEST FRIEND but I dont feel like he is my boyfriend. I dont feel intimate with him and for awhile i was actually concerned i was asexual, but it was just how i feel with him. 

Im dont know if its going to get better, if anything its gotten worse. Should I continue to try and make this work? Will it get better at all or am i just dragging this out longer than it needs

TLDR: I lost all romantic feelings with my boyfriend and i dont know if i should keep fighting for this relationship ",,0,6,2025-04-02 17:27:47
relationships,Gf is stressed by kind parents,"My (M23) girlfriend (f21) an I have been dating for a little over a year. She gets stressed around my parents. Okay so backstory, my parents( who I still live with) were the foundation for who I am today. I love spending time with them They gave me love and kindness when I didn’t deserve it and are some of the sweetest people I’ve ever known. They have always treated anyone I bring to them( friends, girlfriends) with inclusion and respect, part of that respect is talking to them to make them feel like one of the family.

My girlfriend’s family is a little different. They are just as kind but usually stay in their room away from their family. So she is used to having a very quiet house with not much talking.  A few months ago she was pretty clear and almost aggressive that my parents stress her out and over stimulate her and that she has a right to not be talked to as much as they do currently. She has slight autism so I know things are different for her and I feel bad that she feels this way. I tried to get to tell my parents to give us a little time when she comes over before they can speak to her but I’m scared I made them a little sad and that they feel they need to walk on eggshells in their own house now.

Between making sure she’s not stressed and making sure they don’t feel controlled in their own house, I am finding my mind in spirals. If I let them be them in their house then my gf is stressed out and at potential to resent them. If I tell them to stop saying certain things at certain times then they will be saddened and crushed that they can’t speak how we always have.

Can someone please give me some advice on what to do. This is crushing me and really hurting my relationship with my dear parents while also hurting it with the love of my life.

TLDR; my gf gets stressed out and overwhelmed when my family try’s to make friendly conversation.",,0,9,2025-04-02 13:22:33
relationships,My boyfriend (21M) and I (21F) have been out of sync for months. Should my boyfriend and I part ways?,"I (21 F) have been dating my boyfriend (21 M) for over 2 years. Recently we have had issues around intimacy and libido. I personally have a low libido, and I have had bad experiences in my previous straight relationship. As of right now we haven’t been intimate in months. We are both full time university students and are constantly under stress.

I am also dealing with mental health issues, as is he, but he denies that it is mental illness. I am on medication and everything but due to my suspected ADHD I am very bad at taking it (I’m not on meds for it). He doesn’t believe in mental illness as he has a more traditional point of view. He told me he is always there if I want to talk, but it’s hard if he doesn’t understand. 

Recently I have been introspecting about why I might not have a high libido (meds play a part but that’s not the whole reason). I have always been attracted to women more than men (sexually and romantically), whereas with men it is more romantic. I recently made the realization that maybe I don’t want to get intimate due to those feelings. I do love him and he is an amazing man, but I want to make sure he is fulfilled, even if I’m not the one fulfilling him. He is my favorite person in the world and he deserves everything he wants and more, and I’m just worried we will resent each other in the future for just staying together out of love. 

There is also the issue of children. I really want to adopt children, but he wants biological children. I am terrified (which I know everyone says), and I don’t think I would be able to do that or even if I want to do that. I also have a huge fear of needles so I really don’t want an epidural. Right now we live together in an apartment while at school and we have a cat. My parent’s house is an hour away and his is half an hour away. I really don’t want to leave him because he is perfect in every way, but at the same time, I want him to have everything that he wants without compromise. I don’t know what to do

TL;DR my boyfriend and I essentially want different things regarding a family. We live together and have a cat. He is my favourite person ever, and I want him to have everything he wants, even if it’s not with me. ",,0,2,2025-04-02 13:48:14

My Gf 24F and me 25M are in a relationship for 3 years. Her past still bothers me. In the beginning of our relationship we were talking about if we ever cheated. She told me that she cheated on her boyfriend when she was 13 years old by kissing another dude. Afterwards she got into a relationship with someone else for 3 years. She did not cheat physically, but she flirted with another guy before she ended the relationship. With this new guy she was also in a relationship for 4 years and then she cheated on him with her boss. After 3 weeks she broke it off with her ex boyfriend and continued fucking her boss for 3 months. Afterwards she got into a relationship with me. She stopped the affaire with het boss 3 months before we first met. She told me all this in the beginning of the relationship. I was not fine with it, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Now that are relationship is getting more serious and we are talking about getting married I am getting doubt. I love her, I trust her, but I am still not sure if she really changed.

relationships,Struggling to Fully Commit to My Wife Despite Her Love and Support,"TL;DR: I’ve been with my wife (24F) for three years. I (25M) initially didn’t want a serious relationship, but her love and stability drew me in. We have religious differences (she’s Jehovah’s Witness, I’m not), and she isn’t my ideal type, but she has always been deeply committed to me. Despite my concerns and attempts to express them, she would always convince me to stay. We had a quiet court wedding, but I still struggle with fully committing and going public about our relationship. I feel torn between appreciating her love and feeling like I compromised too much.

⸻

I’ve been dating my wife (24F) for about three years. When we first met, I wasn’t looking for a serious relationship, but she was incredibly loving and supportive. She would do anything for me, and over time, I found myself getting deeper into the relationship. She wasn’t necessarily my “ideal” type, but she had a good career, was emotionally stable, and provided a sense of security—something I’ve struggled with as an immigrant while she is American.

From the beginning, I had concerns about our religious differences (she’s a Jehovah’s Witness, and I’m not) and the fact that she didn’t fit what I envisioned in a partner. I voiced these concerns multiple times, but she always reassured me and insisted on making it work. I appreciate her love and the sacrifices she has made for me, yet I find myself hesitating to fully commit. Some days, I want to be with her, but other days, I feel unsure.

Despite my doubts, we went through with a quiet court wedding. However, we don’t fully live together yet. I sometimes regret not standing firm on my feelings earlier in the relationship. Whenever I tried to end things, she would beg and convince me to stay, and I would give in. I often think about how I wanted to walk away after the first or second week of dating when I realized the depth of our religious differences.

Now, I feel stuck in a confusing space. She is everything a loving partner should be, and I recognize the stability she brings into my life. But at the same time, I struggle with the fact that she wasn’t my first choice, and that thought makes it difficult to be fully present in the marriage. I don’t know if I truly love her the way she loves me, and I’m unsure how to move forward.

How do I navigate these emotions and figure out if I should fully commit or reconsider my choices?",,0,31,2025-04-02 17:30:49
relationships,Im (mtf 24) In my first monogamist relationship and seeking advice,"(MTF 24) have been dating my partner (M 27) now for 6 months. He has been incredible in every way. Attentive, caring, tender, very affectionate, kind and makes me feel very special. We see each other often, sexual chemistry is off the charts, He plans special dates, I’ve met his friends (and he’s met mine all of which approve) and will be introducing each other to some family members soon! I feel relaxed, safe and secure when we’re together and do not doubt he cares (always wants to listen / validate my feelings) i’m the first trans girl / person he’s ever been with / dated (he’s bisexual and has been with cis men and women as have I I’m pansexual). So far he’s only been very considerate and  I’ve truly felt like he sees me. We check each others boxes to the T.

I’m an ex-polyamorous person, I was cheated on in my last relationship (a poly structure) and to say it broke me is an understatement. I’m very content with monogamy now (I believe I’m ambiamorous) and so it my partner. I’ve been having crazy sexual experiences (3some’s/multi-play, sex parties, BDSM/kink parties and explore almost each kink in the book haha) since I was 12. My partner has had 3some’s before but I’m the one whose more experienced/ showing him the kink ropes + encouraging him to be the most queer version of himself (which he loves as he’s felt like he had to repress that in past relationships).

Recently I took him to an event at a club that had a dark room night (also we were using several different substances). We’d talked about watching / being sexual with each other around other people. Once we got there he was excited to watch / wanted to go down on each other in front of people. He told me he didn’t realize how hot / exciting he’d find watching. He expressed while it would make him feel really insecure / jealous for me to date / sleep with other people he’d be open / into a 3some but only if I was involved / thought it was hot (something we’ve talked about since the start of our relationship). The next day I realized even 3some’s I wasn’t ready for and felt terrible saying so (as I thought that wasn’t a trigger). He agreed it would open too many questions / risks for the relationship, that he was on drugs and fantasizing bc of how sexual the atmosphere was that he was 1000% okay with our decision to not ever doing a 3some.

While he was extremely explicit with the fact that he just wants me and that I wouldn’t be taking anything from or disappointing him I keep getting this nagging feeling. I worry he will start resenting me (he’s assured he won’t) for my boundary after having given him a peak into this other world. That I am holding him back from exploring it the way I did and that I should breakup with him. Or that in the same way his past relationships made him feel like he couldn’t be fully queer that this one will stifle in the similar fashion for any ENM curiosity. I don’t think it’s fair to keep asking for reassurance when’s he’s done so a few times now I just don’t know how to navigate this and have confused myself.


Tl;dr in a monogamous relationship with BF and I use to be poly- we went to sex party and he was surprised how hot he found watching / being sexual around other people. Said he was open to 3some’s but nothing beyond it. Scared he’ll realize he wants ENM

He’s honestly an amazing person and the only downside is that I don’t like his friends but that’s not a justification for this feeling.  He’s been the best boyfriend ever and he loves me deeply i don’t think I feel the same anymore.

relationships,Should I stop talking to the girl I'm falling in Love with? (I'm 16M and she's 15F),"TLDR (So a little over a month ago we started talking (we knew each other from a dance) and hit it off really well, We talked for hours and hours on the phone and we flirted with each other often. We know each others darkest secrets (I don't have any cray secrets but she does) But I didn't feel different about her after knowing them. so we were playing a game together and she typed something in Russian in chat (Cause she didn't wanna say it in English) So naturally I translated it and it said ""I like \*My name\*"" so I said I like her more!)  
So she told me she liked  me right after apparently some lady in the game liked me and she got really jealous so I said let's just switch servers so you don't have to deal with her. But it seems like she gets jealous relatively easy which is okay cause I do too (Also I never talked to this random lady away from her either) But lately she's bee addicted to a game nonstop playing it, And has been adding random guy's she meets in there and playing games with them all day. Which also resulted in her not answering me for hours  at a time and barely talking to me at all. So I have started spiraling and now I believe I have fallen into Depression. So I told her how I felt about her playing games with these guy's all day and I felt like she was losing interest. And as well pointed out how she felt about me even talking to a lady who she thought liked me. And so she said she was sorry BUT then sent screenshots of each of their profile's trying to say ""oh this guy's bi"" ""this guy has a gf"" ""this guy has a crush"" ""this guy I think is straight idk"" thinking that it would help. But she's been playing with more dudes than that as well. I was telling her last night that I really haven't been doing well and crying a lot at like 2:00AM SHE ANSWERED AT 5:30AM and she said ""Sorry one of my friends on the game was going through a breakup so I was trying to help him"" she was also playing a 2 player game with him that was like one of the games that you only really play with a significant other. I still really like her but it seems that I matter less then some random dudes on the damn internet to her and it has really affected me mentally.",,2,19,2025-04-02 03:50:35
relationships,My (28f) best friend (27f) keeps forcing me to like her bf,"My best friend keeps trying to get me to like her boyfriend

They’ve been together for 8 years and while I thought he was fine in the beginning, over the years he’s started to grate on me.

I just personally find him immature and selfish. He’s unemployed, smokes weed all day, talks over people, doesn’t do his own housework, can’t drive and quite lazy overall. 

My best friend is obsessed with him and I’ve always been polite and nice to him. Never said a bad thing about him to her face. 

However, I think she wants me to hype him up and … I don’t know. She wants me to love him and I just don’t. 

Today is their anniversary and I wished her and her boyfriend a lovely day. 

She replied saying all the great things about her boyfriend and then said:

“You were always there for me in the early days of our relationship to keep me sane …

I’m so glad you two like each other and get along. Because I would hate it if you didn’t” 

And I can tell that she’s trying to bait me into saying I love him like a brother or something which I would’ve said in the past but I hate being fake so I just replied 

“Always here to keep you sane! That’s my job!” 

And didn’t reply to the rest. 


I can tell she’s pissed and I have a feeling that later she’ll be questioning me on it. 

How do I deal with this? I’m not rude to the guy, we’re always polite with each other. But I don’t vibe with him and I think he’s a bit of a crap boyfriend but not once have I said that to my friend (because she’d probably ghost me if I did). 

So why should I have to pretend to love him for her own sake? 

I really just want to say “if you’re happy, I’m happy” but I know that’s code for “I don’t like your partner”. 

How do I phrase this in a way that doesn’t make her stop talking to me? 

TLDR: my best friend keeps trying to get me to say I love her boyfriend even though I find him annoying. How do I set a boundary?

relationships,What should i do in this relationship?,"I am 15M and I have been dating my girlfriend for 9 months, for the first few months its been decent, we had little problems and maybe a few arguments. But the last couple weeks have been me constantly getting berated for asking for stuff i genuinely feel like are pretty easy to understand, i told her i dont appreciate her lying to me because shes been lying to me alot, as well as name calling, blocking me, as well as never taking accountability for her actions and blaming it on me. 
And i have been asking her if she can change those things, but every time i mention it she turns it into an argument and makes it my fault, saying stuff like im stupid and dont understand what shes saying and constantly belittling me, and mentions past mistakes ive done to justify the way she has been treating me, 
Which i personally find unfair considering i have not done any of the things since she told me she didnt like it. She as well knows that ive been struggling mentally for a while and constantly tells me to kill myself, but says its okay and isnt her fault because its a “joke”.She also has friends that constantly insult, and tell her to break up with me because im a terrible boyfriend and so. And whenever i try to talk to them about how i dont appreciate the way they treat me because theyre ruining my relationship they continue to do so. So im honestly so stuck and feel like i cant do anything, because ive become so attached to her because of how she acted before and i still see that girl in her but i dont know if shes ever coming back.

She also used to complain i spent too much time with my best friend so she kinda forced me to go with her, but then she gets angry that im “always on her sh*t” because i spend all my time with her, and give her all my attention. But she cant spare a few hours to go out with me but can have a 4 day sleepover at her friends(saying she doesnt owe me “sh*t”) , cancelling our premade plans in the process.
She also comes from a extremely wealthy family and im like dirt poor near homelessness, and i feel she likes to rub it in alot, saying i dont deserve her because im poor and she has an absent mother and a dad that im pretty certain is a pedophile so im not sure if shes just projecting her family issues onto me, but she always says she thinks i cant take a joke when she jokes about me being poor, or when she gets angry at her father for “only” sending her 100$ to go shopping. 

Im not sure if its because shes genuinely just a spoiled narcissist or if i should try harder, because i worked construction as a carpenter for 12-15 hours a day all summer to try and buy her nice things but i had to give the majority to my parents, so i feel like i am very hardworking and she never acknowledges how hard it is to make money. 

This was not very concise because honestly im just spilling how i feel onto the internet because i dont have very much friends i can vent to, in fact none at all. But im not sure if i should try and continue this because i am so attached with her and i feel like if i left i would be even more alone than i am now. Today i cried in front of everyone full mental break down during school, and she didnt comfort me, in fact she laughed.i had a friend(guy btw)im not even close to comfort me and idk i feel so fucked no matter what and it was probably the most embarrassing thing ever because i look really like toughbut i cry like a baby. 

But like i guess final question are her actions justified because honestly i dont think so, the mistakes ive made in the past consist of me following people at my school, and when i asked her who she wanted me to unfollow she wouldnt tell me, liking her friends that im pretty close withs post, “twisting her words”, “victim shifting” as well as “ always starting arguments” because ive told her how i feel and i dont appreciate how shes been treating me. 

So what do i do? and how because im so lost and alone

TL;DR my girlfriend has been mentally abusive to me and constantly belittles me and laughs at me for asking her to change how she treats me, as well as blaming it on me",,1,2,2025-04-02 07:17:14
relationships,Boyfriend 25M is mad that I 21F got my ears pierced,"I 21F have been dating my boyfriend 25M for almost 3 years. When we started dating I had two ear piercings and no other piercings or tattoos. My hair was also my natural brown color. He has no piercings, tattoos, or colored hair.
About a year ago, I decided to color the bottom half of my hair pink. I come from a family where my mom had a different color hair every month and tattoos and piercings. My dad did not have any of these things but didn't care if she did. So, with this in mind, I just randomly colored my hair, not thinking anything of it. My boyfriend had a come apart and it was a real point of tension for a long time in our relationship. We had conversations about it and I understood why he freaked out on me. So, we put that behind us and moved on. 
This last weekend I was on vacation with my little sister for her birthday. She decided she wanted to get her ears pierced and asked if i would get mine done with her. Of course I said yes in a heartbeat. I got a little 2mm diamond stud on both helixs. Its very small and unnoticeable, especially because I wear my hair down all the time. When I told my boyfriend what i had done, he was really mad at me. To be clear, this wasn't a total surprise, even though I wasn't expecting to do it on this trip. He knew I had been wanting to get my ears pierced for awhile and he did give me some pushback on it. But to be honest, I kind of thought he had to be kidding. I knew he wasn't a fan of facial piercings or tattoos, which i could live with, but ear piercings? 
We are mid-distance so we only see each other every few weeks, so we use snapchat and facetime to talk to each other so we can see each other. Its Monday and I haven't seen his face since Saturday. He has been sending me only ceiling pictures and one word answers. I even facetimed him and he kept me facing the ceiling the whole time. He said he would let me see him ""when he wasn't mad anymore"". What do I do? I can't even be sad right now because I'm starting to get pissed off by his behavior. Are we adults or children? I'm just stumped about this and need some advice on what to do next. Do I give him more time to settle down? Do I try to talk to him about it? 

**TL;DR: I got my ears pierced over the weekend and my boyfriend is mad at me. It's Monday and I haven't seen his face since Saturday. Am I in the wrong here? What do I do now? ",,156,59,2025-04-01 03:19:33
relationships,How do I (F/18) leave my bf (m/18) for his lack of respect of my boundaries?,"We have been together for over a year and things are good sometimes.

We live in a very rural community and consent isn’t dwelled upon or talked about in depth at our public high school. It’s just the simple no means no.

He doesn’t seem to understand that multiple no’s before a yes is not consent. And I’ve talked to him multiple times about it and he’s said he’ll do better but I’ve noticed no improvement.

The only improvement I’ve seen is in myself, when I hold my ground in saying no before he ultimately gives up but he acts upset.

He definitely prioritizes sex every time we hang out. He begs me to let him just “stick it in” and if I say no he’ll beg me and say please over and over until I say yes. 

And when I want to do something that benefits me sexually, he’ll refuse. He definitely only cares about himself and his pleasure. 

I know I should probably find someone better. But I’ve been with him for so long and have bad attachment issues and I don’t know how.

I’m in therapy and we’ve talked about everything but her advice hasn’t been helpful so far. Outside of his lack of respect for my boundaries, I am happy and we have good times when he isn’t thinking with his crotch instead of his head. 

I’m just scared of the inevitable pain I’m going to feel leaving someone I know I still love, even though it will be beneficial to me.

Tldr, me and boyfriend live in rural community where consent isn’t a deeply talked about subject, he begs me to have sex with him until I say yes, but we’ve been together for so long and I have a deep attachment to him and outside of the consent issues, our relationship is good and it feels incredibly difficult to leave him.",,1,14,2025-04-02 06:20:48
relationships,Worried about my boyfriends drinking,"I (21f) been dating my boyfriend (22m) for more than a year now, we have mostly a great relationship; he's the best boyfriend I've had and he is sweet and genuinely cares for me and we are pretty serious about our relationship even though we are young. Now here's the problem: he works in night life and he drinks a lot, it's not always but recently he has been drinking more than I would like. I am no saint and I drink with him as well but I'm a nervous person and know when to stop (except for the occasional night of an extra shot of two) once he starts it's hard to make him stop; he's a nice drunk, sweet and affectionate sometimes I can't even tell how drunk he actually is but he always says he is good to drive (although a couple of times I've had to convince to let me drive or get a hotel) and whenever he drinks he starts craving for coke (something I have told him I don't like) the other night we had a really nice time at one of his gigs but he got so drunk I had to end up babysitting him and cleaning up his vomit till late (even though I had work early the next morning) and it really worried me and bothered me bc he wouldn't hear me when I tell him he's had enough to drink and he insists he doesn't have a drinking problem bc he doesn't drink everyday; I know substance abuse problems run in his family and he has an addictive personality. I don't want to leave him bc I know we are young and he could be experimenting and could learn his limits but I worry about our future, specially bc his career revolves around night life and I always worry about what could happen when I'm not there to stop him taking that extra shot or getting behind the wheel. He is an extremely sweet guy and I really don't want him to go down that path, I feel like he's at a crossroads of a good life and addiction and I don't know what else to do to help him, I really love him, I also now I can be a little controlling but I don't want to marry him and he ends up a drunk. also what if I leave him and there's nobody there for him to help him not Go down that path, he doesn't have that many people that care for him enough to help him see: Thoughts?? Is it just normal at our age and I worry too much? 

TL;DR: Boyfriend works in nightlife and although he's really sweet he's been drinking a lot, after a night he went overboard I worry about his and our future and wonder if he's falling into addiction, what can I do? Or is it normal for our age? ",,1,6,2025-04-02 05:54:58
relationships,I (20M) am struggling to Get Over My Ex After 2 Years. Should I Tell My Current BF (19M) of Almost 1 Year?,"I'm really struggling with something, and I'm hoping to get some advice or perspective here. I've been trying to get over my ex for two years now, but I can't seem to shake him from my mind. 

Here's some background: My ex and I dated for about 4 months, but I had been really into him for over a year before we got together. He was perfect for me—literally everything I ever wanted in a partner. I'd spend hours talking to my friends about him, gushing over how great we were together. We never had any huge fights and no major issues in the relationship. 

He broke up with me the day before I was about to head off to college. He said he didn't think it would be fair to me because he would be bad at staying in touch, and he didn't want to drag things out with a ""break,"" since that would feel noncommittal. He said he wanted to make a definite decision and thought it would be better if we ended things now, even though he still cared about me. I understood his reasoning then, but that doesn't mean it didn't hurt. 

Fast forward to now, two years later, and I can't seem to move on. I find myself still thinking about him a lot—sometimes more than I should. I even have this idealized version of our relationship in my head, where I tell myself he's the ""one who got away"" and that maybe one day we'll randomly run into each other, and everything will fall back into place. I know that sounds ridiculous, but it's a thought I can't shake, even after all this time. 

The thing is, I've been with my current boyfriend for almost a year now, and I really love him. We've got a solid relationship, and I'm happy with him, but here's the issue: I've never told him about my ex. I feel ashamed to admit that I'm still hung up on him after so long, especially when I know I should be over it. I don't want my boyfriend to think I don't love him or that I'm comparing him to someone from my past because that's unfair to him. But the reality is, I think about my ex more than I should, and I feel guilty for it. 

So here's my dilemma: Should I tell my boyfriend about my ex, and if so, how do I bring it up without making him feel insecure or like he's second-best? Or should I just keep this to myself and try harder to move on without sharing this with him? 

I've tried to let go, I've dated two people since (including my current bf), and I've even had therapy to work through it, but no matter what I do, he still lingers in the back of my mind. I'm just at a loss and don't know if I should be more open about it or if keeping it to myself is the best option. 

Any advice on how to handle this would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance!

TL;DR: I've been struggling to move on from my ex, who broke up with me two years ago before I went to college. Even though I'm in a happy, year-long relationship with my current boyfriend, I still think about my ex a lot and idealize our past. I feel guilty for not telling my boyfriend but worry that bringing it up might make him feel insecure. I've tried therapy and dating others but can’t shake thoughts of my ex. I'm not sure if I should open up to my boyfriend or keep trying to move on privately, and I'm looking for advice on what to do.",,0,11,2025-04-02 05:31:22
relationships,I 26M fell in love with a girl 24F who is in a relationship and led me on until breaking my heart.,"I 26M met her 24F one year ago, and from the start, it felt like we had known each other forever. She was easy to talk to, effortlessly funny, the kind of person you could sit with for hours and never run out of things to say. We became close friends almost immediately. At first, my feelings for her were just a quiet admiration, nothing more than a passing thought. But then they grew.

She asked me if I like anyone. It was obvious it was her. She knew it and I knew it. I made it obvious that it was. But then, I found out she had a boyfriend. I didn’t know she was in a relationship. She never mentioned him, not once. By the time I found out, it already felt like something was happening between us. We never talked about him directly, but his presence was always there, unspoken. I knew they were struggling. I knew things weren’t perfect. And maybe that was what made it so easy to pretend—for a while—that what we were doing wasn’t completely wrong.

We talked about our feelings more than once. We both knew it was dangerous, but we kept coming back to it. Neither of us wanted to admit what this was turning into, but we never really stopped it either. We acknowledged how compatible we are and how happy we make each other. Truly, we were perfect together. In every way possible. Apart from the lingering fact that she had a boyfriend at home. I told myself that if things between them ended, maybe there could be something real between us. Maybe this wasn’t just temporary.

They almost broke up once. For a moment, I thought that was it, that things would finally change. But they didn’t. So I told myself to stop. To let go of the idea of her. I tried to be just her friend again, but it never really worked. We kept slipping.

One day, it stopped being just words. She told me she loved me. She kissed me. She held me like I was someone she wanted. And for months, we existed in this space between right and wrong, between what we wanted and what we were allowed to have. She was still with him, but when she was with me, it felt like she was mine. She was mine. She told me she was. Although not official on paper, we were in a relationship. I know it was wrong but I loved her too much to stop. I tried to stop. I couldn’t. I really saw a future with this girl, even after a small amount of time.

But I always knew it wouldn’t last. She was here for a year on an exchange program, and soon, she would be gone. And even if she wasn’t leaving, I knew deep down that this was never real in the way I wanted it to be. Don’t get me wrong, it felt real. But truly, we were never off to a good start giving her relationship. We knew she had a choice to make. Him or me. And we both knew it would be him. It makes sense for it to be him. But still, I stayed. I had to take the chance. I couldn’t let a love like this go. I know I was being led on, and she knows she was leading me on. But we both let it happen. We genuinely were in love. 

Then, one night, she told me she still loved him. That she loved us both, but she needed to see if their relationship could work. 

And just like that, it was over.

Not that it had ever really begun. But that doesn’t make it hurt any less.

She made me believe she loved me, and now I don’t know if any of it was real. If she truly loved me, how could she do this? I’ve lost not just a lover, but my best friend. It hurts in a way I can’t even put into words, but a part of me feels like I have no right to this heartbreak, because she was never really mine. I saw this coming. I could have stopped it. But I didn’t. I love her so much but I know she’ll never be mine. Yet, I’m hopeful. 

The last time I saw her, after this conversation, I should’ve held her tighter and kissed her harder and told her I loved her even more. Maybe that would’ve changed something. I won’t see her now for a few weeks for various reasons. I’m scared for the day that I see her again. Everything will be changed. 

My question is: Can I resume our friendship or is it time for me to move on? 

TLDR: Fell in love with someone in a relationship who ended up choosing their partner despite their issues and how I’m left heartbroken and unsure how to continue. ",,0,6,2025-04-02 14:13:18

OkCupid,I was kept a secret so I agreed to end it,"I met a guy on a dating app, and we clicked instantly. Three days in, we were completely into each other—too fast, I know, but the chemistry was undeniable. For five months, everything felt right, until I started bringing up the idea of meeting in person. That’s when the cracks began to show.

He always avoided the topic, and whenever his family or friends were around, he would abruptly end our calls—even in the middle of a conversation. It felt disrespectful, and despite bringing it up multiple times, nothing changed. His excuse? Relationships aren’t openly accepted in India, and he didn’t want to face scrutiny while still trying to establish his life.

I was willing to accept that meeting up might not be possible right now due to financial constraints. But what hurt was being kept completely hidden. In-person interaction matters to me, but I can compromise—just not to the extent of feeling like a secret. Because no one knew about me, I felt dispensable.

Every time I raised my concerns, it led to fights, no matter how gently I approached the conversation. His only solution? Stop talking. After multiple failed attempts to work things out, we finally ended it for good.

I’m Filipino, and he’s Indian. Maybe it was a cultural difference—Filipinos are open about relationships, while Indians tend to be more private. But it still hurts how easily he let go while I struggle to move on, despite the short five months and the fact that we never even met.

I just needed to vent because this has been too much to process. Still, I want to try dating again soon. I really like Indian men, but is this secrecy common in their culture, or did I just meet the wrong ones?",,1,20,2025-04-02 08:18:13

OkCupid,OKCupid is shadowbanning paid users — here's what happened when I called them out,"I live in the San Francisco Bay Area — a dense dating market — and signed up for OKCupid Premium earlier this year. I set my preferences completely open:

* Distance: 100 miles
* No filters on age, gender, politics, religion, etc.

I wasn’t picky. I swiped liberally. Still:

* Zero likes
* Zero messages
* Repeatedly shown the *same* profiles (some looked like dead accounts or bots)

So I contacted support. I asked directly:

Their response? Copy-pasted help articles, advice to “widen my preferences” (already maxed out), and vague platitudes about user engagement. Then they told me since I paid through Apple, I’d have to go to Apple for a refund — dodging any responsibility for the lack of service.

No transparency. No explanation. No resolution.

This feels like a deliberate **bait-and-switch**. Get users to pay, then quietly throttle visibility to nudge them toward buying boosts or giving up. And from what I’ve read, I’m not the only one this has happened to.

OkCupid,"he wants me, he wants me not rollercoaster of emotions","So, I met a guy in OKC. At first it was only casual conversation then turned into flirting and then deeper conversations. I had some trauma from past relationships and he helped heal me from the pain. I’ve been filled with hope, excitement and a connection I haven’t felt in a long time. 

We moved to other messaging app texted all the time, voice call, video call. At first he told me he wasn’t into LDR, I wasn’t either. But then later on he told me that he thinks it might be a mistake if we don’t try to be more because of our strong emotional connection. I agreed to try. We even agreed to become exclusive. Agreed that we would at least try to make this thing work. 

But shortly after, he told me he don’t find me attractive (edit: he complimented me before) and just wants to be friends. I felt rejected but I passively accepted it even though deep down all I wanted is to keep him. I just wanted to be happy with him. Now I am left with the ache of losing something that felt so right. 

We are still in contact now but obviously, just a friend because he no longer felt the same way about me. I feel like I should just stop talking to him to avoid further heartbreak but it’s like I’m addicted to him.

OkCupid,"I talked with a girl from Peru, she matched me, and wanted to make new friends but there is a catch","She had a real description, she replied but was very cold and weird. She was very good looking

I quickly got agressive cause I knew it was gonna nowhere and she kept replying so I asked for her whatsapp, and she gave it. Then I noticed she was not in the same country as her profile. I told her, she blocked me but I had noted her phone just in case.

I talked to her on whatsapp and she ignored my questions and kinda attacked me, but didn't block me, so I kept going to know a bit, I asked her to make a video to prove it was her and she did. So in the end, she was just trying to befriend guys and have them send her money, she was very cold and weird but now it makes sense, initially it didn't and she seemed totally erratic.

She still liked my banter (it was pretty hardcore to be fair lol) and wished me well when I said i'm not gonna send her any money (she said guys just send her money because they value the time she spent with them).

I would not have guessed this was a way to make money on such sites, now I know.

OkCupid,American Women are giving up on marriage because of divides on politics and care work with men,"[https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/relationships/american-women-are-giving-up-on-marriage-54840971?st=DYkoLN&reflink=mobilewebshare\_permalink](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/relationships/american-women-are-giving-up-on-marriage-54840971?st=DYkoLN&reflink=mobilewebshare_permalink) 

Some excerpts: 

American women have never been this resigned to staying single. They are responding to major demographic shifts, including huge and growing gender gaps in [economic and educational attainment](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/young-american-men-lost-c1d799f7?mod=article_inline), [political affiliation](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/men-women-vote-republican-democrat-election-7f5f726c?mod=article_inline) and beliefs about [what a family should look like](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/conservatives-traditional-family-gender-roles-292fa193?mod=article_inline). 

Over half of single women said they believed they were happier than their married counterparts in a 2024 AEI survey of 5,837 adults. Just over a third of surveyed single men said the same.

A 2022 Pew survey of single adults showed only 34% of single women were looking for romance, compared with 54% of single men, down from 38% and 61% in 2019. \[...\]

Katie spent the first half of 2024 going on three or four dates a week with men she met on apps, such as Hinge and Bumble, in the hopes of finding a husband before turning 30. By the end of the year, she had ramped down the search, calling it “the only thing you can put 10,000 hours into and end up right where you started.” \[...\]

Men’s economic struggles seem to be having the biggest effect on women without a college degree, whose marriage rates by age 45 have plummeted from 79% to 52% for those born between 1930 and 1980, according to research by Cornell University economist Benjamin Goldman. “Young men without a degree are struggling so much as a group that there simply aren’t enough with steady jobs and earnings for non-college women to date,” said Goldman.

For Christina Ralstin, a 31-year-old wildland firefighter in rural Republic, Wash., who didn’t go to college, buying a house was confirmation she didn’t need a partner to be content. She paid $90,000 for a two-bedroom on half an acre of land in 2022. “I’ll have it paid off in the next two years, so I don’t feel like I need to be tied financially to somebody,” Ralstin said. After her last relationship ended in 2023—when she discovered he was still on Tinder—she doubted she would find someone else who aligned with her progressive views in her conservative town. So she stopped looking. “If I need companionship, I volunteer at the dog shelter.”  \[...\]

Married couples had $393,000 in median wealth in 2022, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve, while unmarried people, including those who were partnered but not married, had $80,000. Economists say married couples are more likely to have assets such as homes and cars, which have grown in value faster than wages in recent years. 

# Different world views

For Alicia Jones, not having anyone else to financially depend on—or split rent with—is the worst part of being single. “Especially with the threat of layoffs, it’s much more stressful being a single person,” said Jones, who is 38 and works in communications for a real-estate company in Washington, D.C. 

Her last long-term relationship ended two years ago over conflicting views of their shared future. **“He wanted the white picket fence and me at home with the kids,” Jones said. This despite the fact that her salary was nearly 50% higher than his. Jones, who identifies as politically moderate, thinks couples with kids should split household and child care responsibilities equally. She was surprised by just how few of the men she has encountered in D.C. share this view.** \[...\] Before she pulled back from dating last year, Jones tried her luck at a singles event. She left with three numbers—all belonging to women who became friends, whom she now meets for drinks or dinner multiple times a month. The men at the event, the four women agreed, seemed more interested in the brewery’s board games than in the people in the room, so they spent the night getting to know one another instead. 

A growing political divide between men and women has compounded the challenges of finding love. Around 39% of women ages 18 to 29 identified as liberal in 2024, according to Gallup, compared with 25% of their male peers. This gap has more than tripled in a decade: 32% of women and 28% of men called themselves liberal in 2014. These differences aren’t merely about preferences or votes, explains University of Denver psychology professor Galena Rhoades, who researches romantic relationships. Rather, politics have become an expression of one’s “core values” about everything from economic inequality to bodily autonomy. “They are reflective of people’s world views,” said Rhoades. **The latest presidential election and the first months of the Trump administration have intensified this ideological rift.**  

**Rachael Gosetti, a 33-year-old real-estate agent in Savannah, Ga., said she broke up with her boyfriend, with whom she shares a 5-year-old son, over a year ago because she was tired of doing most of the child care, cooking and scheduling while also earning almost double her boyfriend’s salary. She has yet to date anyone else in part because she worries about living in a red state with a six-week abortion ban.** “I have a child that I can’t leave behind to drive to Virginia if I had a pregnancy scare, and I definitely can’t afford another child as a single mom,” she said.

OkCupid,How US’ New Administration Ruined OkCupid for Me,"I used OkCupid for about nine months and talked to quite a few people—most of them Americans. From my experience, the largest groups on OkCupid have always been Americans, Turks, and Indians, but overwhelmingly Americans.

I’ve always had a natural inclination toward Americans, especially after living in the U.S. for a while. I never really wanted to move there permanently, but I found it easier to connect with them since I already knew their culture and language. The topic of moving countries inevitably came up in conversations, especially because of my work and the fact that I speak English relatively well—although it was always clear to me that the average American I met on OkCupid was below the level of man I could find in my own country (sorry not sorry).

However, ever since Trump came into power and started his crackdown on foreigners, OkCupid completely lost its appeal for me. What’s the point of talking to someone and potentially considering relocating—whether them or me—if their country wouldn’t even welcome me? The entire premise of forming international connections became pointless. For this reason, I permanently deleted my account. 

I feel bad for those who recognize how terrible things have become, but OkCupid was always about 80% Americans. Staying on the platform became completely unviable for me.",,5,23,2025-03-27 02:49:53

OkCupid,Are the women on this app picky or something?,"So I made a new account about a week ago, and recently the app has been letting me swipe right away more than the first few days. I think I've swiped right legitimately like 95% of the time and so far have only gotten two matches. One didn't reply and the other doesn't really have a bio that I could work a message off of. So in reality it's like 0 matches 

Are the women on this app just very picky? I know it's hard to judge what I'm saying because I'm not showing my profile, but I've definitely put the most work into this profile than I ever have to any dating profile I've made. As for how I look, I don't have high self esteem but I got a lot of compliments over this past weekend, so I guess I'm not ugly lol. 

As for location, I'm on Long Island, NY, I get a lot of profiles from the city, it hasn't deterred me away from swiping right. Like I said I probably swiped right 95% of the time ",,0,36,2025-03-25 13:05:46

Nothing about my profile was fraudulent either... ",,5,6,2025-03-24 21:17:06
OkCupid,Feeling Sad About OkCupid,"Before 2015 I had never used a dating site or app. I had very briefly checked one out when I became 18 first, but that was about it. But I had first been single for quite a while, then had a brief relationship, and then I finally decided to give it a shot.

In 2015 I started using OkCupid for the first time. I actually kind of liked it. You had lists of people, a match scores, questions you could answer. And while obviously the pictures still mattered, the focus was on other things first like the bio and the score. Beyond that there was no algorithm that matched you up. You could just pick someone and immediately send them a message.

I talked to some people back then, went on a date with someone that didn't work out, and then about 2 months after I joined finally found someone who became my third girlfriend.

Me and her were together for about 6 years, from the start of 2016 to the start of 2022. But, obviously, that relationship didn't end up working out.

So afterwards I thought I'd give it another try. I went to OkCupid again. The change to a swiping system really annoyed me, but I put up with it because that's the only way apps work nowadays, I guess. I talked to a bunch of poeople there, but a lot of the conversations kind of ended up fading out. One person I spent more time talking to but then I met yet another person and I went on a date with her. This was about 6 months after I joined. And we dated for a while and then at the end of 2022 she became my fourth girlfriend.

We were together for about a year...

I've since rejoined OkCupid and my experience this time has not been what it was.

When I first rejoined it was still ok. A lot of ""changing my location"" and fake scam accounts, much more than before. But I did have some conversations with some women, at least, though all of them ended up going nowhere. More recently though I feel like it has really died out completely.

I don't use it that much anymore, but in the rare instances that I do go on I swipe through and basically 99% of the accounts are either ones I've already seen, or scam accounts, or ""changing my location"" or all of the above. I almost never find someone new who's legit on there anymore. And I've sent a couple of intros since then, though not very many, and I think I literally haven't spoken to anyone there in several months.

Maybe other people's experiences in other geographical regions are different. But to me it really feels that OkCupid as an app is dead. And that makes me pretty sad.

You know, this was the app I met my third and fourth girlfriends on. This was an app I actually enjoyed more than the superficial swipefest that is Tinder, particularly back when it still had a list system. It was a way for me to actually connect to people and find girlfriends I wouldn't have ever met otherwise. And now... idk.

Now it feels like I'll never meet someone through there again. And instead I have to resort to apps like Tinder which I hate.

It's kind of like... when you've biked through a particular street for years and years and years throughout your childhood and early adulthood. And there's some kind of beautiful statue standing there. And you see it every time you pass it. Hundreds or thousands of times. And then one day it's gone and there's just a giant hole in the ground, and workmen digging stuff up and constructing something new. And it just makes you sad because it had been part of your life so long.

Anyway, I know that's all rather maudlin, so I'll end this post here. Makes me sad, is the point. I liked OkCupid, especially in 2015, and I wish we still had that app.",,36,24,2025-03-23 19:36:29

Since I created that OKcupid account a few hours ago in the afternoon I am now sitting at 39 likes and it still slowly increases. As a man my first intuition obviously was that these are likely scam accounts, so I am not sure if I should be happy about being that ""successful"".

OkCupid,Social platform not dating platform romance scams,"I'm guessing or have read that some of the signs that someone you've met online is trying to scam you are as follows:  Looking for any agreement or disagreement

* trying or getting you to move to either (a) private messaging or (b) another unmonitored communication site
* trying to move the relationship way too fast e.g., immediately messaging several times a day (on the second day you accepted a friend request and asking if ""something is wrong"" if you don't answer right away,
* have no information on their bio and name sounds fake - made up identity?
* asking to be friends when you do not have any friends in common and only showing 5 friends - made up identity?
* showing ""widowed""?  probably for sympathy

OkCupid,Why do dating apps always get progressively worse?,"I met one of my partners there (still together, am polyam), found a friend and had two other really promising dates (am very hesitant to go on dates), and a dozen great in depth chats. It was always the GOAT for meeting like-minded people and the percentage really was actually quite solid. Now the percentage is completely arbitrary and doesn't reflect the answers at all - which is a VERY simple math equation, like there's no way they couldn't fix that within a day or two lol.

No pictures on profile texts anymore. Can't sort by key words anymore. Much less free right swipes. I know dating apps are basically love casinos and designed to make you addicted. But at some point I just can't grasp why they keep deterioating apps. Like isn't the pull much better if it at least seems like it's trying to make it a good match experience? I suppose their data showed that too many people did in fact match with others so they had to make it harder?

But there's always an overabundance of lonely people, it's 2025 and people are social media addicts and shit at long-term relationships, why would they need to tweak those numbers if it meant that a competitive dating app, ""the new good one!"", gets an edge, only to repeat that process again?

I just don't get it. I still prefer okc because you can write intros. As a polyamore, chronically ill person who's already in a relationship my dating pool is pretty small so I'm happy for the possibility of long profile descriptions too. But it's just so baffling.",,21,17,2025-03-05 08:21:08

OkCupid,Boring,"Hello OkC people! 

I've been using OkC since back then--about two years ago--for almost two years. Then I deactivated my account. After that, I reopened it and have been using it for almost a year now. I've been matching with people who are my type, but I think something is wrong. Every time they talk to me, they always assume I'm into something nasty and such, even though it's clearly stated in my bio that I'm not and that I'm looking for a serious rs. They find me boring. I'm already 27 (F), but I feel like I'm not meant to have a rs, whether in person or online. I'm not ugly, though. I know I have a sense of humor, I'm educated, and I can communicate well, but I still don't fully understand how online dating works. 😞

Maybe I really am boring. But I know I'm not. Maybe I just haven't met the right person yet. 🥲

""Reset password"" doesn't send me an email either (tried on multiple browsers, multiple times and waited). Since that seems to accept ANY email, even made up ones, that doesn't tell me if my account is still active at all.

So either I have been hacked, or since I never provided a phone number and that since seems to have become mandatory, my account was deactivated.

Questions:

* When did phone numbers become mandatory?

* Did old accounts with no provided phone number eventually get deleted?

* If not, what else can I do to find out what's going on? Customer support wants a phone number, too.

I recently came across a story about how scammers are now using AI to create super realistic dating profiles. We’re talking perfect pictures, smooth conversations, and even deepfake video calls.

I know people can already see my profile, because I've already received multiple email notifications from people reaching out to me. OKC has no phone number to call that I can find and the online help form that I submitted last night has still gone unanswered.

OkCupid,The Art of Flirting: Subtle Moves That Got Me Noticed,"I used to think flirting meant being bold, saying all the right things, and trying way too hard. But I quickly learned that the real magic happens when you don’t overthink it. The key is subtlety—letting your body do the talking without saying a word.

It started with eye contact. At first, it was a little awkward, but I quickly realized that locking eyes for just a second too long can spark something electric. I began practicing with guys in class—holding their gaze, smiling softly, and then looking away just as they were about to catch me staring. That playful tension was all it took to get their attention.

Then there was the way I moved. Instead of rushing, I slowed down. When I walked past someone I liked, I made sure to keep my posture confident, letting them notice the way I carried myself. A slight tilt of my head, a little sway of my hips, and I could see the shift in their interest. I wasn’t trying to be sexy—I was just owning the space I was in.

The real turning point came one night at a party. I was talking to a guy who caught my eye, and instead of bombarding him with questions, I leaned in a little closer when he spoke, making sure to touch his arm lightly as I laughed. His reaction was instant—he leaned in just as much, and I could see the chemistry building.

By the end of the night, we didn’t need to exchange words to know what we were both feeling. The subtle moves—eye contact, body language, and just the right amount of tension—had worked their magic.",,0,6,2025-02-20 18:09:21

After thinking about it more, I'm really not excited to go now. The whole point of meeting is get to know her to see if we're a good match. I think it will be a strange dynamic to have them there. I'm a pretty social person so it's not a matter of being nervous around new people, but more so it feels like I'll be wasting my time now. I didn't decide to make this time investment to chat her best friend and husband up, I was wanting to connect with her.

hingeapp,Does removing profiles (pre-match) from my deck impact my “stats”?,"When I’m going through profiles, I sort them into three buckets: 
(1) Likes (that’s obvious),
(2) “Eh… I’m not feeling it so I’m gonna hit the X” which puts them back into my deck to reconsider later, and 
(3) “Not interested, and Not Gonna Be Interested” so I tap the three little dots and remove them because I’m not interested.

Now, I’m gonna confess, I’m picky and I’m slightly OCD, so I use #3 a *lot.* I just don’t want to clutter up my deck with a bunch of people I have no interest in. 

I’d guess maybe 5% #1, 5% #2, and 90% #3. I hope you don’t judge me for that as much as I judge the profiles, but I live a Midwest US location that most certainly does not have a terrific dating pool. And I’m a 45m with kids, so my target demo is already relatively small. 

It’s also my understanding that when I remove a profile from the deck, I’m removing my profile from their deck, too, right?

I told him last night that I have a habit of not going to class, and he was like “oh yeah, I don’t think I’m going to go tomorrow either”. But… all this time we’ve been talking he goes to class every single day never misses it. Wake up this morning and tell him I didn’t go, he says he didn’t go either. I know this doesn’t sound like much because I haven’t really known him long enough to get a good idea of his habits, but I can just tell by the way he says things that he’s kind of just saying them to agree with me?

hingeapp,Relationship Type filter issue,"It appears there is some sort of bug related to the Relationship Type filter (aka monogamy filter) that went missing after today's app update on iPhone (not sure if this affects Android users or not).

I asked a few people who also both updated the app and did not, and the filter is still present for them. On my end, I don't see the filter anymore, and the one difference I can see is I'm a paid subscriber while others who still have that filter are free users. So perhaps this only affects paid users. 

Before anyone panics, I'm sure this is more likely a bug than an intentional move to remove the filter - because what's the incentive to do so?

hingeapp,How to find compatible matches,"I (F34) am turning 35 this summer and feel that I'm on the wrong side of finding a partner. I spent a lot of my 20's focusing on graduate school and my career and am pretty proud of what I've accomplished. I have two masters degrees, own my own home, and live right outside a major metropolitan city. I have hobbies, and belong to some clubs (mostly book clubs), but more than anything I want a partner and a child. I've been dating intentionally through Hinge for about 2 years, but nothing has worked out. The men I'm meeting either don't want kids or aren't looking for a serious relationship. Honestly it feels hopeless at this point - I'm past my prime and no one that wants kids is going to enter into a relationship with a 35 year old woman. Does anyone else feel this way? How can I craft my Hinge profile to get across my goals without seeming desperate? I feel that I'm a relatively attractive and successful woman so it's disheartening to get few compatible matches. I'm looking for advice, words of encouragement, or suggestions on things to try. 

Some notes:

\- I do belong to social groups. Ironically, I joined with the intention of meeting people in person, yet the groups are almost all exclusively women also looking to meet men in person. 

\- Because of my job and the need to be somewhat anonymous on the internet, I've only used Hinge for dating. I need to be able to proactively block phone numbers so I don't show up in potential matches' feeds. I haven't found that I can do this with Bumble, and have had limited success with Coffee Meets Bagel. I'm willing to pay for an app/website, but don't know much about other options.

Is there a point to pause and then unpause later in the day or at night? 
Does time of day attract different types of men?


Just unsure how it all works because I still get a few (less than 10) likes/roses throughout the day after I've reached the ""max"" likes received.
Does my profile not get shown to others after the limit?

hingeapp,Does she really want to stay in touch?,"I (M 37) went on date with this woman (F 36) last week. She was in my city for work+family, but we've exchanged texts for a couple of weeks -- I was swiping in her city when we matched.

The date went great. Lots of conversations, laughter etc. We were drunk, ended with kissing several times, which we both liked. I definitely wanted to spend more time, she did too, but she had work the next day (that's what she said. Also said ""as much as I'd like to f*** your brains out, I don't want to xD""). So we kissed goodbye and ended the date.

The next day, we texted a bit. I sent the first message. Couple of texts exchanged, and after which there was nothing more from her. Two days later, on her way to the airport, she texted me saying she had a great night with me, and she didn't mean to vanish and was sorry, but she was busy with family etc. And she asked me to ""keep in touch with her!"".

I responded back saying I had a great night too, joked that ""we probably have left some things for the next time, don't we?"", and I'll see her when I visit her city. To which she did not respond :|

Also, she is recently divorced, and I don't think she wants to date seriously right now. And I think she did meet someone else before me, and probably will go on a lot more dates. Which is totally fine, obviously.

My question is, what should I do? I'm attracted to her. The date was fun. I'd be going to her city in 3 weeks so I'd obviously like to see her again. But I feel like, while she asked me to keep in touch, she probably didn't mean it so seriously. More like a customary statement you tell people. Also she has not responded to my last message (which I mentioned above), and also vanished for a couple days after the date. I was actually hoping we'd plan another one while she was still in the city, but she only texted back on her way to the airport.

I don't want to come across as desperate. I'm not. But genuinely confused if I should text her, to have occasional casual conversations until I meet her again, or just let it go?",Dating Question,4,31,2025-03-31 16:29:53
hingeapp,Unmatched while confirming plans.,"I (27M) matched with a girl (23F) a few days ago and we had a nice chat going with instant replies. Yesterday I asked if she was interested in watching a movie together since it’s a common interest of ours. It took a few hours but she said yes and asked for availability. I waited 3 hours to come up with a response (sometimes I get anxious when it comes to replying) and when I felt ready I opened her message and it said she unmatched. I know I shouldn’t get attached to someone I haven’t even met but I can’t help but feel upset. Was this one on me for not replying sooner? 

This is now the 3rd instance of a match ghosting me while we making plans. I know it’s a common occurrence on these apps but it’s getting to me. What are some things I need to watch out for or be mindful of so I can avoid these situations?",Dating Question,76,92,2025-03-30 22:49:45

I (M31) matched with someone (F27) on Hinge about a month ago. We hit it off and eventually, she gave me her number. Our chats weren't continuous but we would message each other about once a day on WhatsApp, which felt like a good connection to me.

However, recently she hid her WhatsApp display picture and it's been a month since she last saw my messages—though they do show the double ticks, so they’ve been delivered. She hasn't unmatched me on Hinge either, which is confusing.

I've never been in a relationship before and this situation is really getting to me. I've never felt this way about someone, and I'm struggling with these emotions. I'm not sure how to move on from this, or if I should message her asking for some closure.

hingeapp,Guy I have been seeing for two months was on a date with another girl,"I (25F) went out last night to a bar with all my friends. I also have been seeing a guy (mid 30s) from Hinge for the past two months now. He takes me on amazing dates, and we have been intimate many times (without protection since we have both been tested). We see each other every week.

Anyway, he lives like 45 minutes away from me. Unless I was going to see him, I almost NEVER go to this part of the city.

Anyway, my friends and I wanted to try a new restaurant in his area. We ate and then went out to the bar. I saw him on a date with a girl. He also lied to me about what he was doing on his Friday night, because clearly he was with this girl.

I hate to admit it but I’m pretty upset. He is the first guy I’ve liked in two years (since my ex) and he was treating me SO WELL. I also hate the fact he lied to me too. What would you do in this situation? He ended up seeing me at the bar. Also, is it normal to feel kind of annoyed about the whole situation?

Edited to add that since this blew up I guess the answer is that I am in the wrong and it’s fine for him to continue to date people. I guess I also shouldn’t feel jealous, it’s hard though.

hingeapp,Seeking for some reassurance,"I(37m) recently matched with a girl(32f) that I'm actually really into. We chatted for a few hours, she seemed very engaged and made some digs at me that I interpret as flirting. Next day we had a phone call for two hours that had pretty good energy. We have a surprising amount of things in common.

I took her to a romantic dinner spot and we split a bottle of wine and stayed until closing. Then she asked to go to a bar for cocktails. I ended up kissing her there because it felt right, and we made out for a while. Then she wanted to go to another spot, and we made out there and hung out until closing.

I drove her home after making out in the car a little bit. Texted her the next day and she agreed to meet up next week again. 

So, I got out of an 8 year relationship a year ago and I still feel new to all this modern dating and hinge. I'm kind of worried about getting too emotionally invested too fast. What's the over under on she's into me as a potential partner vs she's into me as just a fun fling? Looking for a female perspective. This is in LA.

It was notable because there was actual effort put into the message, and we had a few exchanges back and forth (about four) within an hour.  I really thought it was going well, but around 10 PM she stopped messaging, which fine, it's late.

But today there's been no follow-up.  I know you shouldn't get invested in anyone until actually meeting in person, but I really feel like she and I would mesh well together just based off the energy of the exchange (which I don't normally see from matches).

I previously posted on here a couple of weeks ago and since then I’ve met a few guys that I’ve enjoyed getting to know. 

Recently, I’ve been bumping into them since I seem to have mutual acquaintances/friends with some of my hinge dates. Which didn’t bother me until I saw two of the guys speaking to each other at a houseparty. I don’t think they saw me but I have a date coming up with one of the guys. I’m not sure if this is something I need to bring up or if I’m fine to continue as it is. 

I tried to put myself into their shoes and I’d be a bit put off if someone I’m seeing was also seeing my friend. So, I think they have a right to know. Though, I equally think this is expected in online dating. I’d find it slightly crass to say so early on that I’m seeing other guys, who potentially might be their friend.

Not sure how to exactly go about this.

hingeapp,What to do?,"Hello, so I 33yo Male, went out with this girl 36yo Female on hinge and we went out for 6 times thus far. We started talking online for a few days and met up shortly after. I was really open with her and I only had 1 expectation. If at any point she feels unsure or thinks I'm the wrong guy, she has to communicate it with me. That was all.

So anyway, we went hiking and to the beach. I feel the dates went really well and I felt it was really promising. She said she felt the same way too. We held hands, had interesting conversations. But the problem is when we're not talking face to face, she takes 24-48hours to respond. I spoke to her about it and the first time she said she was busy and mentioned she's trying to not fall for a person too quickly (she went through a divorce a few years back) so she keeps conversations to a minimum.

After the 3rd date, she asked me how do I find things going on between us, to which I said it was great. She then told me that she was dating other guys as well to see if there was any romantic connection. I thought, since we weren't exclusive, that's totally fine with me. Also I'm not the type who expects a response every hour, once per 8-12 hours is completely fine with me.

So 3 days ago, we met. After the date, I dropped her a short message saying ""I hope u had a fun time"" and i asked her on another date. Instead of replying she sent me some instagram reel 5 hours later, and she didnt even answer the questions.

I thought she might have missed the message so I asked her if there was something off (about 16 hours later from the time I sent the message). She went completely off the rails and started berating me about how I was actually not ok with waiting 24 hours for a response. I was thinking, what is so difficult with just sending a short response like .. ""i'm busy right now talk to you shortly""? Really how difficult is that. After that she mentioned again that she was still seeing other guys and wanted to take things slow. I just apologised and gave her space.

After thinking really hard for 2 full days, I told her yesterday that as much as I liked her, I don't want to be her backup, and I'm moving on. To which she replied. ""I don't feel like I was confusing or leading you on. I understand and accept your decision, though, since it's not feeling good for you. Since you have made up your mind, best wishes, and too bad it didn't work out longer."" How is kissing and holding hands not leading someone on? But anyway, I decided to just walk away. I really wasn't sure how this would have worked out longer if the communication was almost non-existent. I hope I did not make a mistake. Now that I'm back on Hinge, I saw her profile again and it was ""active today"".

I really am not sure if walking away was the right choice? I don't even know what I did wrong. I am not sure why there's such a disconnect between in person meeting and online. It's really confusing to me. ",Dating Question,0,25,2025-03-29 07:54:06

He basically sent me a screenshot of smth, and I noticed his Hinge app was in the corner left on his screen (iphone thing)

I just assumed that he would have it deleted by then bc we talked about exclusivity not existing in here (context: we’re both new to the country and we’re both asians who’s not used to talking to multiple people)

I’m someone who really hates wasting my time on people who aren’t interested in something serious. Also, I recently moved to America, and dating culture here is so different from back home, so I’m not sure if I should bring it up with him directly or just wait it out. Part of me is wondering if I should move on and not invest too much energy, but I’m also still figuring out how dating apps work, even though I’ve dated and been in talking stages before.

I’m just a bit confused and could use some thoughts on what to do next 😓",Dating Question,2,4,2025-03-28 21:46:27
